## The Problem

### Limited Family Gaming Options

### Security and Privacy Concerns

Online gaming platforms often collect excessive personal data and lack proper protection for minors. COPPA compliance is frequently overlooked in gaming applications. **Our Solution:** Built-in COPPA compliance with minimal data collection and comprehensive security measures.

### Accessibility Barriers

Classic MUDs require specialized clients and technical knowledge, creating barriers for casual users and families. **Our Solution:** Modern web interface with intuitive controls and responsive design.

### Educational Value Gap

Most multiplayer games focus on competition rather than collaboration and learning. **Our Solution:** Cooperative storytelling mechanics with Lovecraftian educational themes.
