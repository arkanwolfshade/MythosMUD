> Spec: Dead Code Cleanup
> Created: 2025-01-27

## Overview

Remove unused files, deprecated classes, and legacy code from the MythosMUD codebase to improve maintainability, reduce cognitive load, and eliminate potential confusion for developers. This cleanup will streamline the codebase while preserving all existing functionality and maintaining our 88% test coverage.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Improvement

As a developer working on MythosMUD, I want to have a clean, well-organized codebase without unused or deprecated code, so that I can focus on implementing new features without confusion from legacy artifacts.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developers will encounter fewer distractions when navigating the codebase, leading to faster feature development and reduced onboarding time for new contributors. The cleanup will remove 4 completely unused files, 3 deprecated classes, and 4 unused functions that currently create noise in the development environment.

### Code Maintainability Enhancement

As a project maintainer, I want to eliminate technical debt from dead code, so that future refactoring and feature development can proceed more efficiently.

**Detailed Workflow:** Removing dead code will reduce the codebase size by approximately 5-8 hours of cleanup work, eliminate potential confusion about which code is actually used, and make the project structure clearer for both human developers and AI agents.

### Testing Efficiency

As a developer writing tests, I want to ensure that removing dead code doesn't impact our comprehensive test suite, so that we maintain our 88% coverage while improving code quality.

**Detailed Workflow:** All cleanup operations will be validated against the existing test suite to ensure no regressions occur. The cleanup will focus on code that has no impact on current functionality or test coverage.

## Spec Scope

1. **Remove Completely Unused Files** - Delete 4 identified unused files that serve no purpose in the current codebase
2. **Extract Legacy Functions** - Move the `load_motd()` function from `server/real_time.py` to a dedicated utility module
3. **Remove Deprecated Classes** - Eliminate 3 deprecated classes that are no longer used in the codebase
4. **Remove Unused Functions** - Delete 4 identified unused functions that create noise without providing value
5. **Update Import References** - Ensure all imports are updated to reflect the new file structure

## Out of Scope

- Refactoring of working code that is currently in use
- Changes to the core game logic or functionality
- Modifications to the testing framework or test files
- Updates to external dependencies or package management
- Changes to the database schema or data structures
- Modifications to the deployment or CI/CD pipeline

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Clean Codebase**: 4 unused files removed, 3 deprecated classes eliminated, 4 unused functions deleted
2. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features continue to work without any regressions
3. **Preserved Test Coverage**: 88% test coverage maintained or improved
4. **Updated Documentation**: Any references to removed code are updated in documentation
5. **Multiplayer Scenarios Validation**: All scenarios in @MULTIPLAYER_SCENARIOS_PLAYBOOK.md continue to pass successfully
