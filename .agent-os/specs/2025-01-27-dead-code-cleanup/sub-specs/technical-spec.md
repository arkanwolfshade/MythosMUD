# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-01-27-dead-code-cleanup/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### File Removal Operations
- **Target Files**: 4 completely unused files identified in the codebase
- **Validation**: Each file must be confirmed as unused through import analysis
- **Backup**: Create backup copies before deletion for potential rollback
- **Documentation**: Update any documentation that references removed files

### Legacy Function Extraction
- **Source**: `server/real_time.py` contains `load_motd()` function
- **Destination**: Create `server/utils/motd_loader.py` module
- **Functionality**: Preserve exact function signature and behavior
- **Import Updates**: Update all imports to reference new location
- **Testing**: Ensure function continues to work in new location

### Deprecated Class Removal
- **Target Classes**: 3 deprecated classes identified in codebase
- **Validation**: Confirm classes are not referenced anywhere in codebase
- **Dependencies**: Check for any indirect dependencies or inheritance
- **Documentation**: Remove any documentation referencing these classes

### Unused Function Removal
- **Target Functions**: 4 unused functions identified
- **Scope**: Functions that are not called anywhere in the codebase
- **Validation**: Static analysis to confirm no references exist
- **Testing**: Ensure removal doesn't break any test cases

### Import Reference Updates
- **Scope**: All Python import statements affected by file moves/deletions
- **Validation**: Run import analysis to identify all affected files
- **Testing**: Verify all imports resolve correctly after changes
- **Linting**: Ensure no linting errors introduced by import changes

### Testing Requirements
- **Coverage Maintenance**: Ensure 88% test coverage is maintained
- **Regression Testing**: All existing tests must continue to pass
- **Import Testing**: Verify all imports work correctly after cleanup
- **Functionality Testing**: Core game features must continue to work
- **Multiplayer Scenarios Testing**: All 7 scenarios in MULTIPLAYER_SCENARIOS_PLAYBOOK.md must pass
  - Scenario 1: Basic Connection/Disconnection Flow
  - Scenario 2: Clean Game State on Connection
  - Scenario 3: Movement Between Rooms
  - Scenario 4: Muting System and Emotes
  - Scenario 5: Chat Messages Between Players
  - Scenario 6: Admin Teleportation System
  - Scenario 7: Who Command Validation

### Code Quality Standards
- **Linting**: No new linting errors introduced by cleanup
- **Formatting**: Maintain consistent code formatting with ruff
- **Documentation**: Update any docstrings or comments that reference removed code
- **Git History**: Maintain clean git history with descriptive commit messages

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are required for this cleanup operation. All work will be performed using existing tools and libraries already present in the codebase.
