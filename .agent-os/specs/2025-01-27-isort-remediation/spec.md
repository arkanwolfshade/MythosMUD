# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: isort-remediation
> Created: 2025-01-27

## Overview

Implement comprehensive import organization improvements across the MythosMUD server codebase to eliminate antipatterns, enhance code maintainability, and establish consistent import standards following isort best practices. This remediation will address circular dependencies, improve import grouping, and ensure compliance with project coding standards.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Enhancement

As a developer working on the MythosMUD server, I want consistent and well-organized import statements, so that I can quickly understand module dependencies and avoid import-related bugs.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Developers can easily identify standard library, third-party, and local imports
- Import statements follow a consistent alphabetical ordering
- Complex import patterns are simplified and documented
- Circular dependencies are eliminated through proper module organization

### Code Quality Assurance

As a code reviewer, I want automated import validation and consistent formatting, so that I can focus on business logic rather than import organization issues.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Automated isort checks catch import organization violations
- Pre-commit hooks ensure consistent import formatting
- Import-related linting errors are minimized
- Code reviews focus on functionality rather than formatting

## Spec Scope

1. **Import Organization Audit** - Comprehensive analysis of all import statements in the server directory
2. **Circular Dependency Resolution** - Identify and resolve circular import dependencies through proper module restructuring
3. **Import Grouping Standardization** - Ensure consistent grouping of standard library, third-party, and local imports
4. **Configuration Enhancement** - Improve isort configuration to match project standards and best practices
5. **Documentation and Guidelines** - Create comprehensive import organization guidelines and best practices documentation

## Out of Scope

- Client-side import organization (React/TypeScript imports)
- Database schema changes
- API endpoint modifications
- Performance optimization unrelated to imports

## Expected Deliverable

1. All server Python files have properly organized imports following isort standards
2. Circular import dependencies are eliminated through proper module restructuring
3. Enhanced isort configuration with project-specific rules and exclusions
4. Comprehensive import organization guidelines and best practices documentation
5. Automated validation tests to ensure ongoing import compliance
