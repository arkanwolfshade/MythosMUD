# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a comprehensive `/health` endpoint for the MythosMUD server that provides real-time system health status, including server availability, database connectivity, memory usage, and active connections. The endpoint will return structured JSON data with appropriate HTTP status codes to enable monitoring systems and administrators to quickly assess server health and diagnose issues.
