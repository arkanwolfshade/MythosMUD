> Spec: Health Endpoint Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-27

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive `/health` endpoint for the MythosMUD server that provides real-time system health status, including server availability, database connectivity, memory usage, and active connections. This endpoint will enable monitoring systems and administrators to quickly assess server health and diagnose issues.

## User Stories

### System Administrator Health Monitoring

As a system administrator, I want to check the server health status through a simple HTTP endpoint, so that I can quickly determine if the server is operational and identify any issues that need attention.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Administrator makes GET request to `/health` endpoint
2. Server responds with comprehensive health status including uptime, memory usage, active connections, and database status
3. Administrator can use this information to make operational decisions

### Monitoring System Integration

As a monitoring system, I want to poll the health endpoint at regular intervals, so that I can track server performance over time and trigger alerts when health metrics fall below acceptable thresholds.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Monitoring system makes periodic GET requests to `/health` endpoint
2. Server returns structured health data with timestamps
3. Monitoring system analyzes response and triggers alerts if needed

### Development Team Debugging

As a developer, I want to access detailed health information during development and testing, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks and system issues quickly.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer accesses `/health` endpoint during development
2. Server provides detailed metrics including memory usage, connection counts, and performance data
3. Developer uses this information to optimize system performance

## Spec Scope

1. **Basic Health Check** - Implement a GET `/health` endpoint that returns server status and uptime
2. **System Metrics** - Include memory usage, active connections, and performance statistics
3. **Database Health** - Verify database connectivity and return connection status
4. **Structured Response** - Return health data in a consistent JSON format with timestamps
5. **Error Handling** - Provide appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for different failure scenarios

## Out of Scope

- Authentication requirements for health endpoint access
- Historical health data storage or trending
- Complex health scoring algorithms
- Integration with external monitoring services
- Health endpoint rate limiting

## Expected Deliverable

1. A GET `/health` endpoint that returns HTTP 200 with comprehensive health data when server is healthy
2. Appropriate HTTP status codes (503, 500) when server is unhealthy or experiencing issues
3. Structured JSON response containing uptime, memory usage, active connections, and database status
4. Integration with existing monitoring router structure for consistent API organization
