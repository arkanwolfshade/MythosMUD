# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-27-health-endpoint/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Endpoint Specification
- **HTTP Method**: GET
- **Path**: `/health`
- **Response Format**: JSON
- **Authentication**: None required (public endpoint)
- **Rate Limiting**: None (health checks should be lightweight)

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "status": "healthy" | "degraded" | "unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "uptime_seconds": 12345.67,
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "components": {
    "server": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "uptime_seconds": 12345.67,
      "memory_usage_mb": 256.5,
      "cpu_usage_percent": 15.2
    },
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "connection_count": 5,
      "last_query_time_ms": 12.5
    },
    "connections": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "active_connections": 3,
      "max_connections": 100,
      "connection_rate_per_minute": 45.2
    }
  },
  "alerts": [
    "High memory usage detected",
    "Database connection pool at 80% capacity"
  ]
}
```

### Health Status Definitions
- **healthy**: All components operational, no critical issues
- **degraded**: Some components experiencing issues but server functional
- **unhealthy**: Critical components failing, server may not be fully operational

### HTTP Status Codes
- **200 OK**: Server is healthy
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Server is unhealthy or degraded
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Health check itself failed

### Performance Requirements
- Response time: < 100ms for healthy server
- Memory overhead: < 1MB per request
- No database queries that could impact game performance
- Non-blocking health checks

### Integration Points
- Leverage existing monitoring router structure
- Use existing connection manager for connection statistics
- Integrate with existing memory monitoring systems
- Utilize existing database connection pool for health checks

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when components are unavailable
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Fallback responses when monitoring systems fail
- Logging of health check failures for analysis

### Security Considerations
- No sensitive information in health responses
- No authentication bypass through health endpoint
- Sanitized error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Rate limiting consideration for production environments
