## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies
- Existing monitoring router structure
- Connection manager for connection statistics
- Memory monitoring systems
- Database connection pool
- Logging configuration

### Security Considerations
- No authentication required for health endpoint
- No sensitive information in responses
- Sanitized error messages
- Rate limiting consideration for production

### Performance Requirements
- Response time < 100ms for healthy server
