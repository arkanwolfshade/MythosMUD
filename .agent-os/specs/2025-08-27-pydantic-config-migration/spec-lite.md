# Spec Summary (Lite)

Migrate from deprecated class-based Pydantic Config to modern ConfigDict approach to eliminate deprecation warnings and ensure future compatibility. Update server/models/health.py to use ConfigDict pattern, following the same approach already used in other schema files. This maintains all existing functionality while adopting recommended configuration patterns and removing warning noise during development.
