> Spec: Pydantic Config Migration
> Created: 2025-08-27

## Overview

Migrate from deprecated class-based Pydantic Config to the modern ConfigDict approach to eliminate deprecation warnings and ensure compatibility with future Pydantic versions. This migration will maintain all existing functionality while adopting the recommended configuration pattern.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Improvement

As a developer, I want to eliminate Pydantic deprecation warnings during testing and development, so that I can focus on actual issues without noise from deprecated configuration patterns.

**Detailed Workflow:** The development team runs tests and sees deprecation warnings about class-based Config usage. After migration, these warnings will be eliminated, providing a cleaner development experience and ensuring the codebase follows current best practices.

### Future Compatibility Assurance

As a system maintainer, I want to ensure the codebase is compatible with future Pydantic versions, so that we can upgrade without breaking changes when Pydantic V3.0 is released.

**Detailed Workflow:** The current codebase uses deprecated class-based Config patterns that will be removed in Pydantic V3.0. By migrating to ConfigDict now, we ensure smooth future upgrades and maintain long-term maintainability.

## Spec Scope

1. **Health Model Migration** - Update server/models/health.py to use ConfigDict instead of class-based Config
2. **Configuration Pattern Standardization** - Ensure all Pydantic models follow the same modern configuration pattern
3. **Deprecation Warning Elimination** - Remove all Pydantic deprecation warnings related to Config usage
4. **Functionality Preservation** - Maintain all existing model behavior and validation rules

## Out of Scope

- Changes to model field definitions or validation logic
- Updates to other Pydantic features beyond Config migration
- Performance optimizations unrelated to configuration
- Changes to API endpoints or business logic

## Expected Deliverable

1. All Pydantic models use ConfigDict instead of class-based Config
2. No deprecation warnings appear during test execution
3. All existing functionality and validation rules remain intact
4. Code follows consistent configuration patterns across all models
