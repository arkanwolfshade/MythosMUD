# Spec Summary (Lite)

Fix the critical server-side event broadcasting system that prevents players from seeing connection and disconnection messages from other players in the same room. This bug breaks core multiplayer functionality by isolating players despite being in the same room, severely compromising the collaborative storytelling experience. The fix involves investigating and repairing the PlayerEnteredRoom and PlayerLeftRoom event firing and broadcasting system to restore proper multiplayer awareness.
