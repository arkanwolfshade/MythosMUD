> Spec: Multiplayer Connection Messaging Fix
> Created: 2025-09-04

## Overview

Fix the critical server-side event broadcasting system that prevents players from seeing connection and disconnection messages from other players in the same room. This bug breaks core multiplayer functionality by isolating players despite being in the same room, severely compromising the collaborative storytelling experience.

## User Stories

### Player Connection Awareness

As a player in a multiplayer room, I want to see when other players enter or leave the room, so that I can be aware of who is present and engage in collaborative storytelling.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Player A is already connected and in a room
2. Player B connects and enters the same room
3. Player A should see a message like "Player B has entered the room"
4. Player B should see no message (as they are the one entering)
5. When Player B disconnects, Player A should see "Player B has left the room"

### Multiplayer Room Presence

As a player, I want to see real-time updates about room occupancy, so that I know who I can interact with and collaborate with in the game world.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Room Info panel should show accurate occupant counts
2. Chat system should display connection/disconnection messages
3. Players should be able to see who is currently present in the room
4. System should handle multiple players entering/leaving simultaneously

## Spec Scope

1. **Server Event System Investigation** - Diagnose why PlayerEnteredRoom and PlayerLeftRoom events are not being fired or broadcast
2. **Event Broadcasting Repair** - Fix the RealTimeEventHandler to properly broadcast connection/disconnection events to other players
3. **Event Flow Verification** - Ensure complete event flow from WebSocket connection → event firing → broadcasting → client reception
4. **Multiplayer Testing** - Verify that connection/disconnection messages appear correctly for all players in the same room

## Out of Scope

- Client-side changes (already completed)
- New multiplayer features beyond basic connection messaging
- UI/UX improvements to the chat system
- Performance optimizations for event broadcasting
- Additional event types beyond connection/disconnection

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Connection Messages** - Players see "Player X has entered the room" when others connect
2. **Functional Disconnection Messages** - Players see "Player X has left the room" when others disconnect
3. **Verified Multiplayer Flow** - Complete end-to-end testing confirms messages appear for all players in the same room
