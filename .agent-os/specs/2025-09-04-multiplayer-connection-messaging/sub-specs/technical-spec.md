# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-04-multiplayer-connection-messaging/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **WebSocket Connection Handler Investigation** - Examine `server/realtime/websocket_handler.py` to verify PlayerEnteredRoom and PlayerLeftRoom events are being fired when players connect/disconnect
- **Event Bus Integration** - Verify that the EventBus is properly publishing and subscribing to PlayerEnteredRoom and PlayerLeftRoom events
- **RealTimeEventHandler Repair** - Fix `server/realtime/event_handler.py` to properly handle and broadcast player connection/disconnection events to other players in the same room
- **Event Broadcasting Logic** - Ensure that when a player enters/leaves a room, the event is broadcast to all other players in that room, but not to the player who is entering/leaving
- **Message Format Verification** - Confirm that the event data structure matches what the client expects (event_type: "player_entered"/"player_left", player_name, message fields)
- **Connection Manager Integration** - Verify that the ConnectionManager properly tracks player connections and room assignments for event broadcasting
- **Error Handling** - Add proper error handling for event broadcasting failures
- **Logging Enhancement** - Add comprehensive logging to track event firing and broadcasting for debugging purposes

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are required for this bug fix. The existing tech stack (FastAPI, NATS, WebSocket, SSE) provides all necessary components for event broadcasting.
