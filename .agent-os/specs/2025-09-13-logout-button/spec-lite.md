# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a themed "Exit the Realm" logout button in the Commands panel that sends a logout command to the server, performs full client-side state cleanup, and returns users to the login screen. The feature includes server-side session termination, 5-second timeout handling, graceful error recovery, and full accessibility support including keyboard navigation and Ctrl+Q shortcut.
