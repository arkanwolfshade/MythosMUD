# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Logout Button Feature
> Created: 2025-09-13

## Overview

Implement a disconnect/logout button in the game client that allows players to safely exit the game and return to the login screen. This feature will provide a clean and thematic way for users to end their gaming session while ensuring proper server-side session cleanup and client-side state reset.

## User Stories

### Primary Logout Functionality

As a player, I want to easily logout from the game and return to the login screen, so that I can end my gaming session cleanly and switch accounts if needed.

When a player clicks the "Exit the Realm" button in the Commands panel, the system should send a logout command to the server, wait for server confirmation (up to 5 seconds), perform full client-side cleanup including clearing all game state and connections, and return the user to the login screen. If server communication fails, the client should still proceed with logout to ensure the user can always return to the login screen.

### Accessibility and Usability

As a player with accessibility needs, I want to be able to logout using keyboard navigation and shortcuts, so that I can access this functionality regardless of my input method.

The logout button should support full keyboard navigation including tab order positioning, ARIA labels for screen readers, and a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Q) for quick access. The button should have proper focus management when returning to the login screen.

## Spec Scope

1. **Logout Button UI Component** - Add a themed "Exit the Realm" button with portal icon and eldritch styling at the bottom of the Commands panel
2. **Server Communication** - Implement logout command sending to server with 5-second timeout and graceful error handling
3. **Client State Management** - Perform full reset of all game state, authentication tokens, and connection cleanup
4. **Accessibility Support** - Include keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support, and Ctrl+Q keyboard shortcut
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of server communication errors while ensuring logout always completes

## Out of Scope

- Confirmation dialogs before logout
- Session persistence or state preservation during logout
- Multiple logout methods or alternative logout locations
- Server-side session timeout handling (existing functionality)
- Logout logging or analytics

## Expected Deliverable

1. A functional "Exit the Realm" button in the Commands panel that successfully logs out players and returns them to the login screen
2. Proper server-side logout command processing that handles session cleanup and connection termination
3. Full accessibility support including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
4. Robust error handling that ensures logout functionality works even during server communication issues
