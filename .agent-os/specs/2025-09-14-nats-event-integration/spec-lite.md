# Spec Summary (Lite)

Replace direct WebSocket/SSE broadcasting with NATS-based event distribution for player_entered, player_left, and game_tick events to create a unified, scalable real-time architecture. The implementation establishes NATS as the single source of truth for all real-time game events while maintaining zero breaking changes to the client interface, enabling horizontal scaling and guaranteed message delivery for multiplayer gameplay.
