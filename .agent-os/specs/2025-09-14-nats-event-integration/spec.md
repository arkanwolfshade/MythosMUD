# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: NATS Event Integration
> Created: 2025-09-14

## Overview

Replace direct WebSocket/SSE broadcasting with NATS-based event distribution for player_entered, player_left, and game_tick events to create a unified, scalable real-time architecture. This implementation will establish NATS as the single source of truth for all real-time game events while maintaining zero breaking changes to the client interface.

## User Stories

### Real-Time Event Distribution

As a game server administrator, I want all real-time events to flow through NATS subjects, so that the system can scale horizontally and provide guaranteed message delivery for multiplayer gameplay.

The system will publish player movement events (player_entered, player_left) to room-specific NATS subjects and game tick events to a global subject, with the NATSMessageHandler routing these events to appropriate WebSocket clients based on room subscriptions and connection status.

### Unified Event Architecture

As a developer, I want a consistent event flow pattern for all game events, so that the codebase is maintainable and new event types can be easily added following the same pattern.

The implementation will create an EventPublisher service that standardizes event publishing to NATS, with all existing direct broadcasting calls replaced by NATS publication, creating a single event flow through the system.

### Scalable Multiplayer Support

As a player, I want reliable real-time updates during multiplayer gameplay, so that I can see other players entering/leaving rooms and receive game state updates without missing messages.

The NATS integration will provide guaranteed delivery and enable horizontal scaling to support 1000+ concurrent players with sub-100ms event latency through room-based event routing and global game tick distribution.

## Spec Scope

1. **NATS Event Publisher Service** - Create EventPublisher class for standardized event publishing to NATS subjects
2. **Extended NATSMessageHandler** - Add event subscription and routing capabilities to existing NATSMessageHandler
3. **ConnectionManager Integration** - Replace direct broadcasting in player_entered/player_left handlers with NATS publication
4. **Game Tick NATS Integration** - Update game tick loop to publish to NATS global subject instead of direct broadcasting
5. **Configuration Updates** - Add NATS event configuration and update tick interval to 10 seconds

## Out of Scope

- Client-side changes (WebSocket/SSE interface remains unchanged)
- New event types beyond player_entered, player_left, and game_tick
- NATS server installation or infrastructure setup
- Performance optimization beyond basic event routing
- Event persistence or replay functionality

## Expected Deliverable

1. All player_entered and player_left events are published to room-specific NATS subjects and successfully routed to WebSocket clients in the appropriate rooms
2. Game tick events are published to a global NATS subject every 10 seconds and broadcast to all connected players
3. The system maintains the same real-time functionality as before but with NATS as the event distribution layer, enabling future scalability improvements
