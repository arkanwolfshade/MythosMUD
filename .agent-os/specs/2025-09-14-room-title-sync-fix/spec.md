> Spec: Room Title Synchronization Fix
> Created: 2025-09-14

## Overview

Fix the race condition in client-side event processing that causes the Room Info panel to display stale room titles when players move between rooms. This will ensure UI consistency and improve user experience by maintaining accurate room information display.

## User Stories

### Accurate Room Information Display

As a player, I want the Room Info panel to always show the correct room title and information, so that I can trust the UI and navigate confidently without confusion.

When I move from one room to another using movement commands like "go west", the Room Info panel should immediately update to show the new room's title, description, and other details. Currently, the panel sometimes shows the old room information even after successful movement, creating confusion about my actual location.

### Consistent UI State

As a player, I want all UI components to reflect the same room information, so that I have a consistent understanding of my current location and surroundings.

The Room Info panel, game log, and other location-dependent UI elements should all display the same room data. When there are discrepancies between what the game log shows (correct new room) and what the Room Info panel shows (stale old room), it creates uncertainty about my actual position in the game world.

## Spec Scope

1. **Event Processing Race Condition Fix** - Resolve the race condition where room_occupants events overwrite room_update events with stale room data
2. **State Synchronization Improvement** - Ensure proper state management to prevent stale room data from being displayed in the UI
3. **Event Ordering Logic** - Implement proper event processing order to handle room transitions correctly
4. **UI Consistency Validation** - Add validation to ensure room data consistency across all UI components

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of the event processing system
- Changes to server-side room update logic (server is working correctly)
- Modifications to other UI panels beyond the Room Info panel
- Performance optimizations unrelated to the race condition

## Expected Deliverable

1. Room Info panel displays correct room title immediately after successful movement commands
2. No race conditions between room_update and room_occupants events that cause stale data display
3. All UI components show consistent room information after room transitions
