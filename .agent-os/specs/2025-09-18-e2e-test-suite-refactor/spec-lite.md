# Spec Summary (Lite)

Refactor the monolithic MULTIPLAYER_SCENARIOS_PLAYBOOK.md into a structured, modular E2E test suite with individual scenario files, master rules, and hybrid Playwright testing approach. This will improve maintainability by reducing AI context requirements, enable selective scenario execution, and provide the most appropriate testing tool for each scenario's complexity level.
