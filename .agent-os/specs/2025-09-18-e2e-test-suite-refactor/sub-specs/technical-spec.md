# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-18-e2e-test-suite-refactor/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### File Structure Implementation
- Create `e2e-tests/` root directory with organized subdirectories
- Implement `MULTIPLAYER_TEST_RULES.md` with configurable timeout settings and common procedures
- Create 21 individual scenario files in `scenarios/` subdirectory with standardized naming convention
- Implement separate `CLEANUP.md` and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` files for supporting procedures

### Scenario File Standardization
- Each scenario file must include: execution steps, expected results, and success criteria checklist
- Reference master rules file for common procedures to avoid duplication
- Use configurable timeout settings based on scenario complexity and performance requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing test execution workflows

### Hybrid Testing Implementation
- Evaluate each scenario for appropriate testing approach (standard Playwright vs Playwright MCP)
- Use standard Playwright for simple single-tab scenarios that can run in CI/CD
- Use Playwright MCP for complex multi-tab scenarios requiring advanced browser automation
- Document testing approach rationale in each scenario file

### Cursor Rules Integration
- Update `run-multiplayer-playbook` rule to reference new modular structure
- Maintain existing execution protocols while enabling selective scenario execution
- Preserve all existing safety checks and server management procedures
- Ensure backward compatibility with current AI execution workflows

### Performance and Maintainability
- Reduce individual file sizes to fit within AI context limits (target: <2000 lines per file)
- Implement clear cross-references between files to maintain execution flow
- Use consistent formatting and structure across all scenario files
- Enable parallel development of different scenario types

## External Dependencies

**No new external dependencies required** - this refactoring uses existing tools and frameworks already in the tech stack:
- Existing Playwright installation for standard tests
- Existing Playwright MCP for complex scenarios
- Existing markdown documentation system
- Existing cursor rules framework
