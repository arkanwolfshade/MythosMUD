# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a logging formatter that automatically converts player GUIDs to display both player name and GUID in the format "<name>: <GUID>" across all server log files. This enhancement improves log readability and debugging capabilities by making player identification more intuitive while maintaining technical precision of GUID tracking through efficient in-memory player data lookup.
