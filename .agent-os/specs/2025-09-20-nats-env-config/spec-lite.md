# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement environment variable-based NATS server path configuration to replace hardcoded path detection in PowerShell management scripts. Developers can set `NATS_SERVER_PATH` in environment files to specify NATS server location, with fallback to existing hardcoded paths for backward compatibility. This improves deployment flexibility across different environments and eliminates dependency on hardcoded path assumptions.
