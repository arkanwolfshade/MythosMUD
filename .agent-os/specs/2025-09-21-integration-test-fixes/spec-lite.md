# Spec Summary (Lite)

Fix all 40 failing Playwright integration tests to achieve 100% test coverage for room synchronization and multiplayer scenarios. The fixes will standardize authentication flows, update selectors to match current UI, add missing data-testid attributes, and implement comprehensive mock server responses. This ensures reliable end-to-end testing of MythosMUD's multiplayer functionality across all browsers.
