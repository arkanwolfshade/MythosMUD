# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Integration Test Fixes
> Created: 2025-09-21

## Overview

Fix all 40 failing Playwright integration tests to achieve 100% test coverage for room synchronization and multiplayer scenarios. This will ensure reliable end-to-end testing of the MythosMUD client-server communication and UI consistency across all browsers.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Experience

As a developer, I want all integration tests to pass consistently, so that I can confidently deploy changes knowing the full system works correctly.

The integration tests cover critical multiplayer functionality including room synchronization, player movement, chat communication, and UI consistency. When these tests fail, developers cannot trust that the system works properly in production scenarios with multiple concurrent users.

### Quality Assurance

As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for multiplayer scenarios, so that I can verify the system handles complex user interactions without manual testing.

The current 40 failing tests represent critical gaps in automated testing coverage. These tests validate real-time communication, state synchronization, and cross-browser compatibility - all essential for a multiplayer MUD experience.

### Continuous Integration

As a DevOps engineer, I want reliable integration tests that don't flake, so that the CI/CD pipeline can provide accurate feedback on system health.

Currently, the integration test failures prevent proper CI/CD validation, making it difficult to catch regressions before they reach production.

## Spec Scope

1. **Room Synchronization Integration Tests** - Fix 8 failing room sync tests by adding missing data-testid attributes and implementing proper mock authentication
2. **Multiplayer Scenarios Tests** - Fix 7 failing multiplayer scenario tests by updating selectors and implementing consistent mock server responses
3. **Authentication Flow Standardization** - Replace real server authentication with mock authentication across all integration tests for consistency
4. **Selector and Element Updates** - Update all test selectors to match current UI implementation and add missing data-testid attributes
5. **Mock Server Response Implementation** - Create comprehensive mock responses for game state, commands, and real-time events

## Out of Scope

- Creating new integration test scenarios (only fixing existing ones)
- Modifying the actual game server implementation
- Changing the core UI components beyond adding data-testid attributes
- Performance optimization of test execution time
- Adding new test frameworks or tools

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 40 integration tests pass consistently across Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit browsers
2. Integration tests use mock authentication and server responses for reliable, isolated testing
3. Test execution time remains under 5 minutes for the full integration test suite
4. Clear, maintainable test code with proper error handling and retry logic
