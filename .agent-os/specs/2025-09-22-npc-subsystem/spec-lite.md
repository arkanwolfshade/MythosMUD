# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a comprehensive NPC subsystem supporting multiple NPC types (shopkeepers, quest givers, passive/aggressive mobs) with deterministic behaviors for MVP and AI integration stubs for future enhancement. The system uses zone-based population management, separate threading with message queues, and integrates with existing movement, combat, and communication systems while maintaining database persistence for definitions and in-memory state management.
