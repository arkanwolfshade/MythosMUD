# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: NPC Subsystem
> Created: 2025-09-22

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive NPC (Non-Player Character) subsystem that supports multiple NPC types with varying levels of sophistication, from simple shopkeepers to complex AI-driven entities. The system will use a hybrid approach with deterministic behaviors for MVP and AI integration stubs for future enhancement.

## User Stories

### NPC Interaction and Behavior

As a player, I want to interact with various types of NPCs (shopkeepers, quest givers, passive mobs, aggressive mobs), so that the game world feels alive and provides meaningful gameplay opportunities.

Players can encounter NPCs that wander, respond to attacks, engage in combat, communicate through chat/whisper, and maintain their own inventories. NPCs will react to player actions, game events, and each other's behaviors, creating dynamic and engaging interactions.

### Admin NPC Management

As an administrator, I want to manage NPC populations and behaviors through configuration, so that I can control game balance and create varied experiences across different zones.

Admins can configure NPC types, population limits per zone, required vs. optional NPCs, and behavior parameters through database configuration and YAML settings.

## Spec Scope

1. **NPC Data Model** - Database schema for NPC definitions and in-memory state management
2. **NPC Types System** - Support for shopkeepers, quest givers, passive mobs, and aggressive mobs with distinct behaviors
3. **NPC Behavior Engine** - Deterministic behavior system with event-driven and tick-based decision making
4. **NPC Communication** - Integration with existing chat/whisper systems for NPC-to-player and NPC-to-NPC communication
5. **NPC Movement System** - Integration with existing player movement system for consistent movement rules
6. **NPC Combat Integration** - NPCs use the same combat system as players for consistency
7. **NPC Population Management** - Zone-based NPC spawning with required/optional population controls
8. **NPC Threading Architecture** - Separate thread for NPC processing with message queue communication
9. **AI Integration Stubs** - Framework for future AI integration while maintaining deterministic MVP behavior

## Out of Scope

- Quest system implementation (separate spec)
- Inventory system implementation (separate spec)
- NPC state persistence between server restarts
- Complex AI behaviors (MVP uses deterministic rules only)
- NPC-to-NPC trading or complex social interactions
- Dynamic NPC creation/modification at runtime
- NPC learning or memory systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional NPCs that can spawn, move, communicate, and engage in combat using existing game systems
2. Admin API endpoints for NPC management and debugging
3. Zone-based NPC population system with configurable spawning rules
4. Message queue architecture supporting NPC actions and inter-NPC communication
5. Database schema and configuration system for NPC definitions and behavior parameters
