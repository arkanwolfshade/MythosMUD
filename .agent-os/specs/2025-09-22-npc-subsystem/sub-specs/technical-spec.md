# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-22-npc-subsystem/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

- **Threading Model**: Separate NPC processing thread with message queue communication to main game loop
- **Message Queue System**: Event-driven architecture using message queues for NPC actions (move, attack, speak, etc.)
- **Database Integration**: Separate database connection pool for NPC operations
- **State Management**: Static NPC definitions in database, dynamic state in memory
- **Integration Points**: Use existing movement, combat, and communication systems

### NPC Types and Behaviors

- **Shopkeepers**: Buy/sell items, inventory management, pricing (inventory system integration stubbed)
- **Quest Givers**: Basic interaction framework (quest system integration stubbed)
- **Passive Mobs**: Wander, respond to attacks, basic interactions
- **Aggressive Mobs**: Hunt players, deterministic combat behavior, territorial behavior

### Performance and Scalability

- **Population Control**: Zone-based NPC limits with required vs. optional spawning
- **Update Frequency**: Event-driven + game tick-based decision making
- **Memory Management**: All NPCs stay in memory during server operation
- **Resource Isolation**: NPC processing isolated from main game loop

### Communication and Integration

- **Player Communication**: NPCs can use existing chat/whisper systems
- **NPC-to-NPC Communication**: NPCs can react to each other's actions
- **Event Subscription**: NPCs subscribe to game events (player entering room, combat starting, etc.)
- **Movement Integration**: NPCs use same movement system as players

### Configuration and Management

- **Database Configuration**: NPC definitions and behavior parameters in database
- **YAML Configuration**: Zone population settings and global NPC parameters
- **Admin API**: Endpoints for NPC management, debugging, and monitoring
- **Runtime Configuration**: Behavior parameters configurable without code changes

### AI Integration Framework

- **Stub Architecture**: Framework for future AI integration without external dependencies
- **Behavior Interface**: Abstract behavior system supporting both deterministic and AI-driven actions
- **Message Compatibility**: AI responses integrated through same message queue system
- **Fallback System**: Deterministic behaviors as fallback for AI failures

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required for MVP implementation. The system will use existing:

- FastAPI for API endpoints
- SQLite for database operations
- Existing threading and message queue patterns
- Current WebSocket/SSE communication infrastructure

Future AI integration may require additional dependencies, but these will be added in separate specifications.
