# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a character profession selection system during character creation that allows players to choose from available professions, with stat requirements gating profession selection and influencing stat rolling outcomes. The system provides character specialization foundation with MVP professions (Tramp and Gutter Rat) having no requirements, while the technical architecture supports future expansion with stat-gated professions and mechanical effects.
