# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement automatic NPC spawning during server startup to populate the world with static NPCs based on existing NPC definitions. This extends the comprehensive NPC subsystem by adding server startup initialization that automatically spawns required NPCs and optionally spawns additional NPCs based on configuration, ensuring the game world is immediately functional after server restart.
