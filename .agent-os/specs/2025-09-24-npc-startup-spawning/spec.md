# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: NPC Startup Spawning System
> Created: 2025-09-24

## Overview

Implement automatic NPC spawning during server startup to populate the world with static NPCs based on existing NPC definitions. This extends the comprehensive NPC subsystem (2025-09-22) by adding server startup initialization that automatically spawns required NPCs and optionally spawns additional NPCs based on configuration.

## User Stories

### Automatic World Population

As a **server administrator**, I want **NPCs to automatically spawn when the server starts**, so that **the game world is immediately populated with essential NPCs like shopkeepers and quest givers**.

The system will read NPC definitions from the database and automatically spawn required NPCs (marked with `required_npc=true`) during server initialization, ensuring the world is functional immediately after startup.

### Configurable Startup Spawning

As a **game master**, I want **control over which NPCs spawn during startup**, so that **I can configure the initial world population without manual intervention**.

The system will support configuration options to control startup spawning behavior, including which NPC types spawn, spawn probabilities, and population limits during initialization.

## Spec Scope

1. **Server Startup Integration** - Extend server lifespan to automatically spawn NPCs during initialization
2. **Static NPC Spawning** - Spawn required NPCs and configurable optional NPCs during startup
3. **Startup Configuration** - Database-driven configuration for startup spawning behavior
4. **Integration with Existing Systems** - Leverage existing NPC services and spawning infrastructure
5. **Error Handling and Recovery** - Robust error handling for startup spawning failures

## Out of Scope

- Dynamic spawning during gameplay (already implemented)
- NPC behavior modifications (already implemented)
- Admin API changes (already implemented)
- Database schema changes (already implemented)
- NPC instance management (already implemented)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Automatic Startup Spawning** - NPCs spawn automatically when server starts
2. **Configuration Integration** - Startup spawning controlled via database configuration
3. **Error Recovery** - Failed spawns are logged and don't prevent server startup
4. **Integration Verification** - Startup spawning integrates seamlessly with existing NPC subsystem
