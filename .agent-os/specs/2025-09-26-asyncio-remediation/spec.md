> Spec: Asyncio Remediation Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-26

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive asyncio remediation program to fix critical stability issues in MythosMUD's server architecture that could disrupt multiplayer gaming sessions. This three-phase plan addresses EventBus threading/async hybrid anti-patterns, SSE cancellation problems, and lifespan task management to ensure stable, reliable real-time communication for family gaming experiences.

## User Stories

### Critical Server Stability

As a MythosMUD player in a family gaming session, I want seamless real-time connectivity during multiplayer gameplay, so that we can maintain uninterrupted storytelling immersion without connection failures from asynchronous code issues.

**Detailed Workflow:** Families playing together need reliable real-time event propagation between players without risk of connection timeouts or dropped messages. Server should gracefully handle heavy concurrent event loads during peak gameplay moments without asyncio-blocking operations that could freeze the game session.

### Reactive Server Resource Management

As a server administrator maintaining the MythosMUD infrastructure, I want predictable memory usage and task lifecycle management, so that long-running game sessions don't accumulate resource leaks that could impact stability for subsequent players.

**Detailed Workflow:** The server handles multiple simultaneous player connections with efficient task creation/cleanup. Server processes gracefully restart during maintenance without memory buildup from improperly terminated async operations, maintaining consistent system performance for continuous game operation.

### Form Testing Harmonization

As a developer maintaining MythosMUD's test infrastructure, I want standardized asyncio testing patterns throughout the codebase, so that all backend testing follows consistent async patterns and preventable concurrency bugs are caught early.

**Detailed Workflow:** Test suite follows unified async execution patterns preventing nested event loop creation during automated testing routines. Developers can identify asyncio regressions immediately following reliable async test patterns that mirror production behavior.

## Spec Scope

1. **EventBus Re-architecture** - Replace hybrid threading/async implementation with pure asyncio pattern eliminating dangerous resource leaks and thread safety violations
2. **SSE Connection Lifecycle Management** - Implement proper cancellation boundaries and graceful shutdown for server-sent event streams to prevent client connection drops
3. **Lifespan Task Coordination** - Create centralized task lifecycle management system for FastAPI startup/shutdown ensuring all async operations terminate cleanly
4. **Memory and Resource Cleanup Standardization** - Establish predictable cleanup patterns for all async task creation and cancellation workflows to prevent resource exhaustion
5. **Test Asyncio Pattern Standardization** - Resolve test file inconsistencies by implementing unified async testing patterns across all server test modules

## Out of Scope

- Database query optimization with async corridors
- New real-time messaging protocols beyond current SSE/WebSocket patterns
- Frontend React asyncio integration modifications
- Performance optimization for individual async operations
- External dependency replacements (unless existing libraries prove insufficient for remediation needs)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Server event bus operates using pure asyncio implementation with zero threading hybrid operations
2. SSE streams show proper cancellation handling during server shutdown/restart without client hang states
3. All lifespan-managed tasks receive proper cleanup documentation with measurable shutdown completion timing
4. Test suite demonstrates consistent async pattern enforcement across all server test modules
5. Code review confirms elimination of critical patterns identified (hybrid threading, asyncio.run() anti-patterns, task leak risk scenarios)
