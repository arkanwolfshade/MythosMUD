# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-26-asyncio-remediation/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Phase 1 - Pure Asyncio EventBus Implementation:** Replace `server/events/event_bus.py` hybrid threading/async pattern with pure asyncio.Event/@asyncio.lock implementations for subscriber management
- **Phase 1 - SSE Stream Cancellation Boundaries:** Implement `asyncio.CancelledError` encapsulation within `server/realtime/sse_handler.py` `game_event_stream()` coroutine with proper finally-block cleanup
- **Phase 1 - Lifespan Task Monitor:** Create centralized task registry in `server/app/lifespan.py` that tracks all created tasks with graceful shutdown timeout (5 second) implementation
- **Phase 2 - Memory Leak Prevention:** Replace implicit task creation with tracked task references stored in dedicated manager object enabling full lifecycle tracking
- **Phase 2 - Resource Pool Manager:** Implement connection_pool-style cleanup for NATS subscriptions and WebSocket connection active task tracking with timeout escalations
- **Phase 2 - Periodic Memory Audit:** Create managed_task_cleanup() function enabling runtime detection of orphaned asyncio.Task references before memory threshold exhaustion
- **Phase 3 - Test asyncio Standardization:** Replace all `asyncio.run()` calls in `server/tests/` modules with pytest-asyncio fixtures following unified test patterns
- **Phase 3 - Test Task Isolation:** Implement test session boundary enforcement preventing local event-loop conflicts between atomic test cases across module hierarchy
- **Phase 3 - Integration Testing Consistency:** Replace conditionally imported asyncio scenes with standard TestingAsyncMixin providing predictable async test environments across complete server test suite
- **Implementation Validation:** Each phase requires functional tests ensuring async operation stability under peak concurrent load scenarios (20+ simulation connections generating rapid event bursts)
- **Performance Measurement:** Benchmark particularly EventBus throughput comparing threading.* vs pure async by measuring thousands of rapid event publications against connection thread-safe vs asynchronous subscriber execution timeframes

## External Dependencies (Conditional)

**IF asyncio remediation identifies needs beyond standard library capabilities:**
- **asyncio-mqtt** - [IF WebSocket persistent connection callback handling upgrades require advanced asyncio queue implementation not covered by basic event loop.]
- **Justification:** Only needed if Advanced Message Queue Protocol features require extended task handler monitoring
- **aiomonitor** - [IF runtime task visibility requirements exceed current development environment monitoring capabilities for orphaned thread detection.]
- **Justification:** Only if built bare-minimum asyncio tracking demonstrates insufficient garbage collection
