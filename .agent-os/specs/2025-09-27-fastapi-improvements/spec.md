> Spec: FastAPI Improvements
> Created: 2025-09-27

## Overview

Implement comprehensive FastAPI improvements to address critical security vulnerabilities, architectural anti-patterns, and performance issues identified in the server codebase. This will enhance security posture, improve maintainability, and align with FastAPI best practices while maintaining existing functionality.

## User Stories

### Security Administrator

As a security administrator, I want the FastAPI server to have proper security headers and middleware configuration, so that the application is protected against common web vulnerabilities and follows security best practices.

The system should implement comprehensive security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), fix duplicate middleware registration, and restrict CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized access and protect against XSS and CSRF attacks.

### Developer

As a developer, I want the FastAPI application to follow proper architectural patterns with service layers and consistent async/await usage, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and performs efficiently.

The system should implement service layer patterns to separate business logic from route handlers, ensure all I/O operations are properly async, and consolidate logging middleware to reduce overhead and improve debugging capabilities.

### System Administrator

As a system administrator, I want the FastAPI server to have proper error handling and monitoring capabilities, so that I can effectively troubleshoot issues and maintain system reliability.

The system should maintain the existing comprehensive error handling system while fixing middleware duplication issues and ensuring proper logging without performance degradation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Security Headers Implementation** - Add comprehensive security headers middleware including HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options
2. **Middleware Consolidation** - Fix duplicate ErrorLoggingMiddleware registration and consolidate multiple logging middlewares into a single comprehensive solution
3. **CORS Configuration** - Replace hardcoded permissive CORS settings with environment-based configuration and specific method/header restrictions
4. **Service Layer Implementation** - Extract business logic from route handlers into dedicated service classes following the Service Layer Pattern
5. **Async/Await Consistency** - Ensure all I/O operations in route handlers are properly async to prevent blocking the event loop

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of the authentication system
- Database schema changes
- Client-side modifications
- Performance optimization beyond async/await fixes
- New feature development

## Expected Deliverable

1. All critical security vulnerabilities are resolved with proper headers and middleware configuration
2. Route handlers follow service layer pattern with business logic properly separated from HTTP concerns
3. All I/O operations are async and the application maintains consistent performance characteristics
