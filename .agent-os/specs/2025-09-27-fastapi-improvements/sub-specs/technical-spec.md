# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-27-fastapi-improvements/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Security Headers Middleware**: Implement custom middleware class that adds comprehensive security headers to all HTTP responses including Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy
- **Middleware Consolidation**: Create single ComprehensiveLoggingMiddleware that combines access logging, error logging, and request logging functionality while removing duplicate ErrorLoggingMiddleware registrations
- **Environment-Based CORS**: Replace hardcoded CORS origins with environment variable configuration using ALLOWED_ORIGINS, restrict allow_methods to specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and limit allow_headers to essential headers (Authorization, Content-Type)
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Extract business logic from route handlers into dedicated service classes (PlayerService, RoomService, etc.) with proper dependency injection using FastAPI's Depends system
- **Async Route Handlers**: Convert all route handlers that perform I/O operations to async functions and ensure all database operations use async patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: Implement proper dependency injection for services using FastAPI's Depends system to replace direct app.state.persistence access
- **Error Handling Preservation**: Maintain existing comprehensive error handling system while fixing middleware duplication issues
- **Configuration Management**: Add environment variable support for security headers configuration and CORS settings
- **Testing Compatibility**: Ensure all changes maintain existing test coverage and add new tests for security middleware functionality

## External Dependencies

- **No new external dependencies required** - All improvements use existing FastAPI, Starlette, and Python standard library functionality
