# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: isort-remediation
> Created: 2025-09-27

## Overview

Implement comprehensive import organization and isort configuration improvements to eliminate duplicate imports, optimize import performance, and establish consistent import standards across the MythosMUD server codebase. This remediation addresses subtle but important code quality issues that could impact maintainability and performance.

## User Stories

### Import Organization Cleanup

As a developer, I want all imports to be properly organized and free of duplicates, so that the codebase is clean, maintainable, and follows Python best practices.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Remove duplicate imports in main.py and world_loader.py
- Optimize import statements for better performance
- Establish consistent import ordering across all server modules

### Security and Performance Optimization

As a system administrator, I want import statements to be optimized for security and performance, so that the server starts faster and is less vulnerable to import-related security issues.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Replace complex dynamic import logic with cleaner, more secure alternatives
- Optimize import placement to reduce startup time
- Ensure all imports follow security best practices

### Developer Experience Improvement

As a developer working on the MythosMUD codebase, I want consistent import organization and clear isort configuration, so that I can easily understand and maintain the code structure.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Add explicit isort configuration to pyproject.toml
- Ensure all imports follow the same organizational pattern
- Provide clear documentation for import standards

## Spec Scope

1. **Duplicate Import Removal** - Remove redundant import statements in main.py and world_loader.py
2. **Import Logic Optimization** - Simplify complex dynamic import patterns in world_loader.py
3. **isort Configuration** - Add explicit isort settings to pyproject.toml for consistency
4. **Import Organization Standards** - Establish and enforce consistent import ordering across all server modules
5. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize import placement for better server startup performance

## Out of Scope

- Major refactoring of import structure (only cleanup and optimization)
- Changes to external dependencies or package structure
- Modification of core functionality (only import organization)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All duplicate imports removed and import statements optimized for performance and security
2. Explicit isort configuration added to pyproject.toml with appropriate settings for the project
3. All server modules follow consistent import organization standards with no isort violations
4. Improved server startup performance through optimized import placement
5. Comprehensive test coverage to ensure import changes don't break functionality
