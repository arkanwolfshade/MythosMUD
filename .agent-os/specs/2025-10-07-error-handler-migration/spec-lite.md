# Spec Summary (Lite)

Migrate legacy error handling functions to the new modular architecture by extracting sanitization utilities into a dedicated module, removing deprecated exception handlers and the ErrorResponse class, and updating all imports and tests. This completes the transition to the standardized error handling system introduced during the Pydantic audit, eliminating code duplication and architectural confusion.
