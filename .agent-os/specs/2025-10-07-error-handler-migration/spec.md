> Spec: Legacy Error Handler Migration
> Created: 2025-10-07

## Overview

Migrate legacy error handling functions from `server/legacy_error_handlers.py` to the new modular error handling architecture, eliminating code duplication and completing the transition to the standardized error handling system introduced during the Pydantic audit.

## User Stories

### Cleanup Legacy Error Handling Architecture

As a developer, I want all error handling to use the new modular system, so that I have a single, consistent approach to error handling throughout the codebase without confusion about which functions to use.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Developer needs to handle errors and looks for the appropriate utilities
- All error handling functions are clearly organized in the new modular structure
- No confusion about whether to use legacy or new functions
- Documentation clearly indicates the correct import paths

### Improve Code Maintainability

As a maintainer, I want sanitization utilities separated from error handling logic, so that I can more easily locate and modify security-critical sanitization code.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Security review requires examining all HTML sanitization code
- All sanitization functions are in a dedicated, easily-located module
- Clear separation between sanitization utilities and error response generation
- Tests for sanitization are organized separately from error handler tests

### Complete Migration to New Architecture

As a system architect, I want to remove all legacy error handlers that have been superseded by the new middleware system, so that the codebase reflects the current architecture without dead code or deprecated patterns.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Remove old exception handler functions that are no longer called
- Remove the `ErrorResponse` class that duplicates functionality
- Update all tests to use the new error handling infrastructure
- Ensure backwards compatibility is not needed due to complete migration

## Spec Scope

1. **Create Sanitization Module** - Extract all sanitization functions into `server/error_handlers/sanitization.py` with proper documentation and type hints
2. **Remove Legacy Exception Handlers** - Delete deprecated exception handler functions (`mythos_exception_handler`, `general_exception_handler`, etc.) that are superseded by the new middleware
3. **Remove ErrorResponse Class** - Delete the `ErrorResponse` class since `StandardizedErrorResponse` provides equivalent and superior functionality
4. **Update All Imports** - Find and fix all imports from legacy error handlers to use the new modular structure
5. **Migrate Test Suite** - Update all tests to import from new locations and verify functionality

## Out of Scope

- Creating new error handling functionality (only migrating existing code)
- Changing the behavior of existing error handling (maintain exact same functionality)
- Modifying the new modular error handlers created during Pydantic audit
- Performance optimization of error handling (focus is on code organization)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Clean Module Structure** - All sanitization functions in dedicated `sanitization.py` module with no legacy error handler file remaining
2. **Updated Tests** - All tests passing with imports updated to use new modular structure
3. **Zero Import Errors** - No remaining imports from `legacy_error_handlers.py` anywhere in the codebase
