# Spec Summary (Lite)

Convert 10 of 21 multiplayer E2E test scenarios from AI Agent + Playwright MCP execution to automated Playwright CLI tests for faster feedback, reduced costs, and CI/CD integration. Implement test database seeding using the existing `data/` directory structure with automated cleanup mechanisms to ensure test isolation and repeatability. Update GitHub Actions workflows to run automated tests on PR creation, while refactoring the remaining 11 scenarios that require true multi-player real-time coordination into a more focused and efficient MCP-only playbook.
