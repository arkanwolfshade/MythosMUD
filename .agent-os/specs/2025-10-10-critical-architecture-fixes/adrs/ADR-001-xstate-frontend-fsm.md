# ADR-001: XState for Frontend Connection State Machine

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTED
**Decision Makers**: Prof. Wolfshade, AI Assistant
**Context**: CRITICAL-1 Connection State Machine Implementation

---

## Context and Problem Statement

The frontend connection management in `useGameConnection.ts` had grown to 750+ lines with complex manual state tracking using multiple refs and timers. This led to:

1. **Implicit State Bugs**: Impossible states like "connected but also connecting"
2. **Manual Timer Management**: Complex timeout handling prone to memory leaks
3. **Difficult Testing**: No way to verify state transitions systematically
4. **Poor Visibility**: No clear view of current connection state or transition history

**Question**: What state management library should we use for robust frontend connection handling?

---

## Decision Drivers

- **Type Safety**: Must provide TypeScript support and type-safe state definitions
- **Testability**: Must enable comprehensive unit testing of state transitions
- **Visualization**: Should support visual debugging of state machines
- **React Integration**: Must integrate cleanly with React hooks
- **Bundle Size**: Should be reasonable (<100KB added to bundle)
- **Maintainability**: Must be actively maintained with good documentation

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: XState
- **Pros**:
  - Industry-standard FSM library (used by Microsoft, Amazon, etc.)
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Visual debugging with XState Inspector
  - Comprehensive testing utilities
  - Official React integration (`@xstate/react`)
  - Extensive documentation and community
- **Cons**:
  - ~50KB bundle size impact
  - Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with FSMs
  - V4 to V5 migration happening (but V5 is stable)
- **Bundle Impact**: ~50KB

### Option 2: Manual State Machine
- **Pros**:
  - Zero bundle size impact
  - Complete control over implementation
  - No external dependencies
- **Cons**:
  - Must implement all FSM logic manually
  - No visual debugging tools
  - Higher maintenance burden
  - No type-safe state transitions
  - Requires custom testing utilities
- **Bundle Impact**: 0KB

### Option 3: Robot (State Machine Library)
- **Pros**:
  - Lightweight (~5KB)
  - Simple API
  - Functional approach
- **Cons**:
  - Limited TypeScript support
  - No visual debugging
  - Smaller community
  - Less mature than XState
- **Bundle Impact**: ~5KB

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: **XState v5** with @xstate/react integration

**Rationale**:

1. **Type Safety**: XState provides excellent TypeScript support with typed states, events, and context
2. **Testing**: Built-in testing utilities make state transitions easy to verify
3. **Debugging**: XState Inspector provides visual debugging - invaluable for complex connection flows
4. **Maturity**: Industry-proven library with extensive real-world usage
5. **React Integration**: `@xstate/react` provides idiomatic React hooks
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and active community
7. **Bundle Size**: 50KB is acceptable given the benefits

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- 50KB bundle increase (acceptable for improved reliability and developer experience)
- Learning curve for team (offset by better long-term maintainability)

## Implementation Details

### State Machine Definition

```typescript
export const connectionMachine = setup({
  types: {
    context: {} as ConnectionContext,
    events: {} as ConnectionEvent,
  },
  // ... actions, guards, delays
}).createMachine({
  id: 'connection',
  initial: 'disconnected',
  states: {
    disconnected: { /* ... */ },
    connecting_sse: { /* ... */ },
    sse_connected: { /* ... */ },
    connecting_ws: { /* ... */ },
    fully_connected: { /* ... */ },
    reconnecting: { /* ... */ },
    failed: { /* ... */ },
  },
});
```

### React Hook Wrapper

```typescript
export function useConnectionState(options?: {
  maxReconnectAttempts?: number;
  onStateChange?: (state: string) => void;
}): UseConnectionStateResult {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(connectionMachine, {
    context: { /* ... */ },
  });

  // ... returns type-safe state checks and actions
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Eliminated Implicit State Bugs**: Impossible states are now prevented by the FSM
✅ **Improved Testability**: 13 comprehensive tests verify all state transitions
✅ **Visual Debugging**: XState Inspector provides real-time state visualization
✅ **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches invalid state transitions at compile time
✅ **Maintainability**: Clear, explicit state machine logic replaces 750 lines of ad-hoc state management
✅ **Automatic Recovery**: Built-in reconnection with exponential backoff

### Negative

⚠️ **Bundle Size**: +50KB to production bundle (acceptable trade-off)
⚠️ **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand FSM concepts (mitigated by good documentation)
⚠️ **Dependency**: Adds external dependency (but mature and well-maintained)

### Neutral

ℹ️ **Migration Effort**: Requires refactoring `useGameConnection.ts` (planned work)
ℹ️ **Version 5**: Using XState v5 (latest stable) - may have fewer Stack Overflow answers than v4

---

## Validation

- ✅ All 13 frontend state machine tests passing
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Bundle size increase within acceptable limits (<100KB)
- ✅ React 19 compatibility verified (with --legacy-peer-deps)
