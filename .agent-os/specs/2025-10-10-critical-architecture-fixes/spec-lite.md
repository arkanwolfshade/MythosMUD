# Spec Summary (Lite)

Address four critical architectural vulnerabilities in MythosMUD over two one-week sprints: implement connection state machines (XState/python-statemachine) to eliminate race conditions, refactor configuration to Pydantic BaseSettings with validation, harden command processing against injection and alias bombs with rate limiting, and add NATS error boundaries with retry logic and dead letter queuing. Breaking changes acceptable, ~80% test coverage required, incremental deployment as fixes complete.
