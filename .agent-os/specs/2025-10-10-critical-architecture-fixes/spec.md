> Spec: Critical Architecture Fixes
> Created: 2025-10-10

## Overview

Address four critical architectural vulnerabilities identified in the MythosMUD architecture review that pose immediate risks to security, reliability, and user experience. This comprehensive remediation effort will implement proper state management, secure configuration, command validation, and error boundaries across the application stack over two one-week sprints.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Reliable Game Connections

As a **player**, I want my game connection to remain stable and automatically recover from network issues, so that I can enjoy uninterrupted gameplay without losing my session or game state.

**Workflow:** When a player's network connection drops temporarily (e.g., switching WiFi networks, brief ISP interruption), the game client should automatically detect the disconnection, attempt reconnection using a well-defined state machine, provide clear visual feedback about connection status, and seamlessly restore the game state upon successful reconnection without requiring manual intervention.

**Problem Solved:** Eliminates frustrating connection drops, reduces player support tickets related to "lost connections," and prevents player desynchronization in multiplayer scenarios.

### Story 2: Secure Game Operations

As a **system administrator**, I want the game server to be protected against malicious command sequences and alias bombs, so that the game remains available and performant for all legitimate players.

**Workflow:** When a malicious actor attempts to create recursive alias chains or execute command injection attacks, the server should detect the circular dependencies before execution, enforce rate limits on command processing, log the suspicious activity for security audit, and gracefully reject the malicious commands with appropriate error messages without affecting other players' gameplay.

**Problem Solved:** Prevents denial-of-service attacks through alias bombs, protects against command injection vulnerabilities, and maintains game server stability under attack conditions.

### Story 3: Reliable Configuration

As a **developer**, I want clear, validated configuration management with explicit error messages, so that I can deploy the game confidently across different environments without configuration drift or security leaks.

**Workflow:** When deploying the game to a new environment (local/staging/production), the developer provides environment-specific configuration through `.env` files or environment variables. The system validates all required fields at startup, provides clear error messages for missing or invalid configuration, and ensures type-safe configuration access throughout the application without relying on hardcoded defaults.

**Problem Solved:** Eliminates configuration drift between environments, prevents accidental exposure of secrets through defaults, and ensures reliable deployments with early failure detection.

### Story 4: Transparent Message Delivery

As a **player**, I want to reliably receive all chat messages and game events, so that I stay informed about game state changes and can communicate effectively with other players.

**Workflow:** When the server sends a game event or chat message through the NATS messaging system, the message should be delivered with retry logic for transient failures, logged with detailed metrics for monitoring, placed in a dead letter queue if delivery consistently fails, and acknowledged upon successful delivery to ensure no messages are silently dropped.

**Problem Solved:** Eliminates silent message loss, provides visibility into message delivery failures, and ensures critical game events always reach players.

## Spec Scope

1. **Connection State Machine (CRITICAL-1)** - Implement XState-based finite state machine for frontend connection management and python-statemachine for backend connection lifecycle, eliminating race conditions and providing clear connection state transitions.

2. **Secure Configuration System (CRITICAL-2)** - Refactor configuration management to use Pydantic BaseSettings with environment-specific validation, removing hardcoded defaults and implementing type-safe configuration access.

3. **Command Security Hardening (CRITICAL-3)** - Implement circular dependency detection for alias expansion, add per-player command rate limiting, validate command content before execution, and add audit logging for security-sensitive commands.

4. **NATS Error Boundaries (CRITICAL-4)** - Add message retry logic with exponential backoff, implement dead letter queue for failed messages, add circuit breaker pattern for message processing, and integrate FastAPI metrics for message delivery monitoring.

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - Implement unit and integration tests for all new code achieving ~80% coverage, with specific focus on security-critical command validation and state machine transition testing.

## Out of Scope

- **Monitoring Infrastructure** - No Prometheus/Grafana deployment; will use built-in FastAPI metrics only
- **Database Migration** - PostgreSQL migration deferred to future sprints
- **Distributed Tracing** - OpenTelemetry integration deferred to future work
- **Rate Limiting Middleware** - API-level rate limiting (HIGH-3) deferred to next initiative
- **Backward Compatibility** - Breaking changes acceptable; no migration scripts for old configurations or aliases
- **UI/UX Changes** - No visual design changes except connection status indicators
- **Performance Optimization** - Focus on correctness and reliability, not performance tuning
- **Additional HIGH/MEDIUM Findings** - Only addressing the 4 CRITICAL findings in this spec

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Sprint 1 Completion (Week 1):**
   - Configuration system refactored to Pydantic BaseSettings with full validation
   - Command security hardening implemented with circular dependency detection and rate limiting
   - NATS message handler updated with retry logic and error boundaries
   - All backend changes have ≥80% test coverage
   - No regression test failures
   - Backend deployable to staging environment

2. **Sprint 2 Completion (Week 2):**
   - XState connection state machine implemented for frontend with clear visual indicators
   - python-statemachine integrated for backend connection lifecycle management
   - Integration tests verifying end-to-end connection recovery scenarios
   - All frontend changes have ≥80% test coverage
   - No regression test failures
   - Full system deployable to production

3. **Post-Implementation:**
   - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting state machine choices and configuration strategy
   - Updated deployment documentation reflecting new configuration requirements
   - Security audit log demonstrating command validation protection
   - Metrics dashboard showing message delivery success rates
   - Developer documentation for state machine debugging and visualization tools
