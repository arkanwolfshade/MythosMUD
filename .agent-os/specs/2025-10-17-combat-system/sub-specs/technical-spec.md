# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-01-27-combat-system/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Overview

The combat system will be implemented using a modular approach that integrates with existing MythosMUD systems:

```
server/game/
├── combat_service.py          # Core combat business logic
├── combat_state_manager.py    # Combat state tracking and management
└── combat_message_service.py  # Combat message generation and formatting

server/commands/
├── combat_commands.py         # Combat command handlers (attack, punch)

server/events/
├── combat_events.py           # Combat-specific event types
```

### Core Combat Mechanics

- **Turn-Based System**: Combat rounds based on 6-second game ticks with automatic progression
- **Auto-Progression**: Combat automatically continues through rounds every 6 seconds until completion
- **Turn Order**: Dexterity-based turn order (descending dexterity values)
- **Damage System**: Fixed 1 damage per attack for MVP
- **Health Tracking**: Real-time health display during combat with on-demand status checking
- **Combat State**: In-memory state management with automatic cleanup and turn progression
- **Target Validation**: Room occupant targeting with existing look command logic
- **NPC Passive Behavior**: NPCs perform non-combat actions during their turns (defensive maneuvers, taunts, thematic behaviors)

### Command System Integration

- **Primary Command**: `attack <target>` with target validation
- **Aliases**: `punch`, `kick`, `strike` (all do 1 damage)
- **Validation**: Extended validation with combat-specific rules
- **Rate Limiting**: Leverage existing command rate limiting system
- **Security**: Use existing security measures plus combat-specific validation

### Event System Integration

- **Extend Existing Events**: Add combat data to `NPCAttacked`, `NPCTookDamage`, `NPCDied`
- **New Combat Events**: `CombatStarted`, `CombatEnded`, `PlayerAttacked`
- **Event Publishing**: Use existing NATS event publishing system
- **Event Broadcasting**: Combat messages to Game Info panel via existing event system

### Database Integration

- **No Schema Changes**: Use existing JSON fields in NPC definitions
- **Combat Data Storage**: Store in `base_stats` and `behavior_config` JSON fields
- **Data Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "base_stats": {
      "hp": 10,
      "max_hp": 10,
      "xp_value": 5
    },
    "behavior_config": {
      "combat_messages": {
        "attack_attacker": "You swing your fist at {target_name} and hit for {damage} damage",
        "attack_defender": "{attacker_name} swings their fist at you and hits you for {damage} damage",
        "attack_other": "{attacker_name} swings their fist at {target_name} and hits for {damage} damage",
        "death_message": "The {npc_name} collapses, dead"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### State Management

- **In-Memory Storage**: Combat state stored in memory using dictionaries/lists
- **Turn Progression**: Automatic turn advancement every 6 seconds with combat state updates
- **State Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of stale combat states (timeout-based)
- **Player Disconnection**: Combat continues with timeout-based cleanup
- **Server Restart**: All combat states cleared on server restart
- **Health Tracking**: Real-time health updates stored in combat state (NPC health in-memory only, player health persisted to database)

### Messaging System

- **Message Templates**: NPC-specific templates with variable substitution and health information
- **Perspective-Based**: Different messages for attacker/defender/other players with health updates
- **Thematic Content**: Cthulhu Mythos-themed messages including NPC non-combat actions
- **Broadcasting**: Real-time messages to all room occupants with automatic turn progression
- **Message Storage**: Combat messages in Game Info panel with health tracking
- **Health Display**: Real-time health updates in combat messages (e.g., "9/10 HP remaining")

### Integration Points

- **Room Service**: Use existing room occupant tracking for targeting
- **Player Service**: Integrate with existing player XP and stats system, persist player health changes to database
- **NPC Service**: Extend existing NPC behaviors and lifecycle management, track NPC health in memory only
- **Event System**: Full integration with existing event bus architecture
- **Command System**: Extend existing command validation and processing
- **Security System**: Leverage existing rate limiting and input validation

### Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Data Structures**: Use appropriate data structures for combat state
- **Minimal Database Queries**: Cache combat data in memory
- **Event Optimization**: Efficient event publishing and handling
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of stale combat states

### Error Handling

- **Extended Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and logging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Combat ends cleanly on errors
- **Thematic Error Messages**: Cthulhu Mythos-themed error messages
- **Error Recovery**: Basic error recovery with combat state cleanup

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual combat functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test integration with NPC, event, and messaging systems
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all combat functionality including edge cases
- **Performance Tests**: Basic performance benchmarks to ensure no server degradation

### Configuration Management

- **YAML Configuration**: System-level combat settings in existing config files
- **Database Configuration**: NPC-level combat settings in database JSON fields
- **Runtime Changes**: Support for runtime configuration changes
- **Feature Flags**: Combat system enable/disable via feature flags

### Security Requirements

- **Extended Security**: Combat-specific security measures and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Leverage existing command rate limiting
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for combat commands
- **Audit Logging**: Combat actions logged for security monitoring

### Deployment Strategy

- **Feature Flag Deployment**: Deploy with feature flag for easy enable/disable
- **Direct Deployment**: Deploy directly to production with feature flag
- **Rollback Strategy**: Simple rollback via feature flag disable
- **Basic Monitoring**: Essential combat metrics and error alerting

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. The combat system will leverage existing MythosMUD infrastructure including:

- Existing event system (EventBus, NATS)
- Existing command validation system
- Existing database persistence layer
- Existing messaging and real-time communication
- Existing security and rate limiting systems
