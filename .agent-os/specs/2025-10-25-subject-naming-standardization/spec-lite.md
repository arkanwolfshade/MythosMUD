# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a centralized subject naming convention system for NATS messaging that provides consistent, hierarchical, and validated subject patterns across the MythosMUD chat system. The system will include a NATSSubjectManager class for centralized pattern management, runtime validation of subject patterns, and migration from existing ad-hoc subject construction to standardized patterns.
