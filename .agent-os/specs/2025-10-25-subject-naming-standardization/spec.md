# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Subject Naming Standardization
> Created: 2025-10-25

## Overview

Implement a centralized subject naming convention system for NATS messaging that provides consistent, hierarchical, and validated subject patterns across the MythosMUD chat system. This standardization will improve message routing reliability, debugging capabilities, and system maintainability by establishing clear naming conventions and validation rules.

## User Stories

### Centralized Subject Management

As a **developer**, I want to use a centralized subject naming system, so that I can ensure consistent message routing and reduce subject naming errors across the chat system.

The system will provide a `NATSSubjectManager` class that centralizes all subject pattern definitions, validation logic, and subject building functionality. Developers will use predefined patterns instead of manually constructing subjects, reducing typos and ensuring consistency.

### Subject Validation and Error Prevention

As a **system administrator**, I want automatic subject validation, so that invalid or malformed subjects are caught before message transmission and system reliability is improved.

The validation system will check subject patterns against defined schemas, validate required parameters, and provide clear error messages for invalid subjects. This prevents message delivery failures and improves debugging capabilities.

### Hierarchical Subject Organization

As a **developer**, I want hierarchical subject organization, so that I can easily understand message flow and implement efficient subscription patterns.

Subjects will follow a clear hierarchy: `{service}.{channel}.{scope}.{identifier}` (e.g., `chat.say.room.arkham_1`, `chat.whisper.player.user123`). This structure enables efficient wildcard subscriptions and clear message categorization.

## Spec Scope

1. **NATSSubjectManager Class** - Centralized subject pattern management with validation and building capabilities
2. **Subject Pattern Registry** - Predefined patterns for all chat channels with parameter validation
3. **Subject Validation System** - Runtime validation of subject patterns and parameters
4. **Migration Strategy** - Gradual migration from existing subject patterns to standardized ones
5. **Documentation and Examples** - Comprehensive documentation with usage examples and best practices

## Out of Scope

- Changes to existing NATS message payload structure
- Modifications to WebSocket communication protocols
- Database schema changes for subject storage
- Real-time subject pattern updates without server restart

## Expected Deliverable

1. A fully functional `NATSSubjectManager` class with pattern registry and validation
2. All existing chat services migrated to use standardized subject patterns
3. Comprehensive test coverage for subject validation and pattern building
4. Documentation with examples showing proper subject usage patterns
