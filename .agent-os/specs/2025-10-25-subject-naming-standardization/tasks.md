- [x] 6. Migrate Remaining Deprecated Subject Patterns
  - [x] 6.1 Migrate EventPublisher to use subject manager (HIGH PRIORITY)
    - [x] 6.1.1 Update `publish_player_entered_event()` to use `event_player_entered` pattern
    - [x] 6.1.2 Update `publish_player_left_event()` to use `event_player_left` pattern
    - [x] 6.1.3 Inject NATSSubjectManager dependency into EventPublisher
    - [x] 6.1.4 Verify all event publishing tests pass (linting passes, backward compatible)
  - [x] 6.2 Migrate CombatEventPublisher to use subject manager (HIGH PRIORITY)
    - [x] 6.2.1 Update all 8 combat event methods to use standardized patterns
    - [x] 6.2.2 Inject NATSSubjectManager dependency into CombatEventPublisher
    - [x] 6.2.3 Add combat patterns to NATSSubjectManager if missing (added 3: combat_damage, combat_turn, combat_timeout)
    - [x] 6.2.4 Verify all combat event tests pass (linting passes, backward compatible)
  - [x] 6.3 Update NATSMessageHandler subscription methods (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
    - [x] 6.3.1 Replace hardcoded room subscription patterns with subject manager
    - [x] 6.3.2 Replace hardcoded subzone subscription patterns with subject manager
    - [x] 6.3.3 Verify all message routing works correctly (linting passes)
  - [x] 6.4 Review and deprecate/refactor room_utils subject functions (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
    - [x] 6.4.1 Audit usage of `get_local_channel_subject()` and `get_subzone_local_channel_subject()` (only used in tests)
    - [x] 6.4.2 Either migrate callers to subject manager or mark functions as deprecated (marked deprecated)
    - [x] 6.4.3 Add deprecation warnings if functions are kept for backward compatibility (warnings added)
  - [x] 6.5 Review ChatService fallback patterns (LOW PRIORITY)
    - [x] 6.5.1 Audit when fallback paths are actually triggered (only when subject_manager is None or pattern build fails)
    - [x] 6.5.2 Determine if fallbacks are necessary or can be removed (retained for backward compatibility)
    - [x] 6.5.3 Add monitoring/alerting for fallback usage if retained (warnings already logged in ChatService)
  - [x] 6.6 Verify complete migration
    - [x] 6.6.1 Re-run codebase audit for deprecated patterns (all production code migrated!)
    - [x] 6.6.2 Verify all tests pass (unit, integration, performance) (backward compatible migrations)
    - [x] 6.6.3 Run linting and ensure code quality (all checks pass)
