# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement complete player death and respawn system with mortally wounded state (0 to -10 HP), automatic HP decay of 1 per game tick, incapacitation with red UI effects, and thematic resurrection via interstitial screen. Players respawn at Arkham Sanitarium with full HP after viewing death narrative and clicking "Rejoin the earthly plane" button, with proper combat threat queue management for multi-player scenarios.
