# Spec Summary (Lite)

Complete all incomplete implementations (TODOs) in existing MythosMUD systems to enhance security, functionality, and code quality. This initiative addresses 15 identified gaps including critical security fixes (JWT secrets, admin roles, CSRF validation), combat system enhancements (damage calculation, death handling), NPC behavior controls, and code quality improvements. Focus is on completing existing systems rather than building new features like inventory or status effects.
