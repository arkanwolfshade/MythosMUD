# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a player position system where standing is default and players can sit or lie via slash commands and aliases.
Positions persist across sessions, restrict movement when seated or prone, trigger descriptive room notifications, and
appear in `/whoami` plus the Player Information panel.
