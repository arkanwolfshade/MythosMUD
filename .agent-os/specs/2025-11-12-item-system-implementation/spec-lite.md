# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement the MythosMUD item system through phased delivery: establish the prototype registry, guarded item factory, persistence with seeded SQLite environments, and the `/summon` administrative command (items now, NPC stubs next). Each phase carries explicit testing and observability requirements to ensure end-to-end coverage.
