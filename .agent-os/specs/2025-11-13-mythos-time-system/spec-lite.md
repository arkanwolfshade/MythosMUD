# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement the MythosChronicle time system that compresses real time 1:9.6, freezes on downtime, and resumes deterministically to drive all in-game cycles. Author JSON-based holiday and schedule definitions spanning Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, and neo-pagan observances, limiting bonuses to two Mythos days. Surface Mythos clock, holiday alerts, and lighting cues in the client UI so the accelerated world feels coherent to players.
