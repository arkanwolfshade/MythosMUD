# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement the MythosChronicle time system that compresses real time 1:9.6, freezes on downtime, and resumes deterministically to drive all in-game cycles. Author JSON-based holiday and schedule definitions spanning Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, neo-pagan, and Mythos cult observances (documented in `docs/MYTHOS_HOLIDAY_CANDIDATES.md` with seed data in `data/calendar/holidays.json`), limiting bonuses to two Mythos days. Surface Mythos clock, holiday alerts, and lighting cues in the client UI so the accelerated world feels coherent to players.
