# Spec Summary (Lite)

Deliver a unified container system so environmental props, wearable gear, and corpses can expose secure storage with auditable interactions. The backend adds ContainerComponent persistence, mutation-safe APIs, and corpse lifecycle automation, while the React client gains split-pane looting, backpack tabs, and countdown overlays for shared looting compliance.
