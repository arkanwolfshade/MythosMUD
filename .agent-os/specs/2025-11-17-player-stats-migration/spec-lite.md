# Spec Summary (Lite)

Migrate all player statistics from 1-20 range to 1-100 range to provide greater granularity in character progression. Update model constraints, stat generation (15-90 range), formulas (attribute modifiers, max health/sanity), combat calculations, and reset all existing player data to new defaults (50 for core attributes). All tests and client display must be updated to reflect the new system.
