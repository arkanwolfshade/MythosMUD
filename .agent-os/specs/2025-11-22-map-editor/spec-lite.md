# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement an interactive room map visualization and editor using React Flow for both player exploration and admin room layout editing. The feature provides a standalone `/map` route with custom nodes representing rooms and directional edges showing exits, supporting view-only mode for players and edit mode for admins with drag-and-drop repositioning and connection management.
