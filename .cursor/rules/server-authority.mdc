# Server Authority (Critical)

**The server is always authoritative over the client.** If there is a disparity between server state and client
state, the server is assumed to be correct.

## Implications

- **State sync:** Client state must be updated to match server data. Never treat client-held state as the source
  of truth when it conflicts with server responses or events.
- **Conflict resolution:** Prefer server payloads (e.g. `room_state`, `game_state`, command responses) over
  client-inferred or cached state.
- **Debugging:** When behavior differs between client and server, assume the server implementation is correct
  unless proven otherwise; fix client handling or display to align with server.
