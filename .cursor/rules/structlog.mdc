# Structured Logging with Structlog Best Practices

This document outlines best practices and coding standards for implementing structured logging with structlog to improve debugging, monitoring, and observability.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

### 1.1. Directory Structure

Organize your structured logging implementation with clear separation of concerns:

```
project_name/
├── src/
│   ├── logging/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── config.py        # Logging configuration
│   │   ├── formatters.py    # Custom formatters
│   │   ├── processors.py    # Custom processors
│   │   └── handlers.py      # Custom handlers
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── logging_utils.py # Logging utilities
│   └── main.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_logging.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

### 1.2. File Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names for logging modules
- Follow language-specific naming conventions
- Use clear, consistent naming for formatters and processors

### 1.3. Module Organization

- **Configuration:** Centralize logging configuration
- **Formatters:** Organize custom formatters by output format
- **Processors:** Separate processors by functionality
- **Handlers:** Organize handlers by destination

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 2.1. Design Patterns

- **Structured Logging:** Use structured data for all log entries
- **Context Propagation:** Propagate context across service boundaries
- **Correlation IDs:** Use correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Log Aggregation:** Aggregate logs for analysis and monitoring

### 2.2. Recommended Approaches

- Use structured data formats (JSON, key-value pairs)
- Implement proper log levels and filtering
- Use correlation IDs for request tracing
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### 2.3. Anti-patterns

- Don't log sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- Avoid unstructured log messages
- Don't ignore log performance implications
- Avoid logging too much or too little information

## 3. Performance Considerations

### 3.1. Optimization Techniques

- Use asynchronous logging for high-throughput applications
- Implement log batching for better performance
- Use efficient serialization formats
- Optimize log message formatting

### 3.2. Memory Management

- Monitor memory usage of logging operations
- Use efficient data structures for log entries
- Implement proper cleanup of log resources
- Avoid memory leaks in long-running processes

## 4. Security Best Practices

### 4.1. Common Vulnerabilities

- **Information Disclosure:** Avoid logging sensitive information
- **Log Injection:** Sanitize log messages to prevent injection
- **Access Control:** Implement proper access control for logs
- **Data Retention:** Implement proper log retention policies

### 4.2. Security Implementation

- Sanitize all log messages
- Implement proper access control for logs
- Use secure log storage and transmission
- Implement proper log retention policies

## 5. Testing Approaches

### 5.1. Unit Testing

- Test logging configuration in isolation
- Mock external logging dependencies
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use test fixtures for consistent testing

### 5.2. Integration Testing

- Test complete logging workflows
- Test log aggregation and analysis
- Test performance under load
- Test error recovery scenarios

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Gotchas

### 6.1. Frequent Mistakes

- Not handling logging failures properly
- Ignoring log performance implications
- Not updating logging configurations regularly
- Using logging that is too verbose or too sparse

### 6.2. Debugging Strategies

- Use structured logging for better debugging
- Implement proper error reporting
- Use log analysis tools
- Monitor logging performance

## 7. Tooling and Environment

### 7.1. Recommended Development Tools

- **Structlog:** Official structlog library for your language
- **Testing:** Logging testing frameworks
- **Monitoring:** Log aggregation and analysis tools
- **Logging:** Structured logging with correlation IDs

### 7.2. Build Configuration

- Use version control for logging configurations
- Implement automated logging updates
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Document logging purposes and requirements

### 7.3. Deployment Best Practices

- Install logging tools in development environments
- Use CI/CD integration for logging validation
- Implement proper logging version management
- Monitor logging performance in production

### 7.4. CI/CD Integration

- Run logging validation in CI/CD pipelines
- Automate logging updates
- Implement logging failure notifications
- Monitor logging performance and reliability

By following these best practices, you can implement effective structured logging with structlog that improves debugging, monitoring, and observability.
