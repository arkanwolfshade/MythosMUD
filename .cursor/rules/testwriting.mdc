Avoid Mock-Only Tests: Always ensure tests exercise real production code paths
Test Configuration Separately: Keep configuration testing separate from production code testing

**Security Testing**: Include tests for security vulnerabilities, especially COPPA compliance and data privacy
**Input Validation Testing**: Test all user inputs for injection attacks and malicious data
**Privacy Testing**: Ensure no personal data is collected from minors in test scenarios
**Coverage Requirements**: Maintain 80% minimum test coverage (target 90%) for all new features
