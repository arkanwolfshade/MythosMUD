# Test Writing Standards

Avoid Mock-Only Tests: Always ensure tests exercise real production code paths

Test Configuration Separately: Keep configuration testing separate from production code testing

**Security Testing**: Include tests for security vulnerabilities, especially COPPA compliance and data privacy

**Input Validation Testing**: Test all user inputs for injection attacks and malicious data

**Privacy Testing**: Ensure no personal data is collected from minors in test scenarios

**Coverage Requirements**: Maintain 70% minimum test coverage for all new code. Critical files (security, core
 features, user-facing code) must maintain 90% minimum coverage.
