# Load pylint-per-file-ignores plugin for per-file suppressions
# This allows us to suppress specific rules for specific file patterns,
# matching ruff's per-file-ignores configuration
load-plugins=pylint_per_file_ignores

[FORMAT]
# Line-length checks disabled project-wide; max-line-length unused for enforcement
max-line-length=120
# Maximum module lines (project standard is 500 per user rules) - KEEP enforced
max-module-lines=550

[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Line-length checks disabled globally; file length (max-module-lines) remains enforced
# Disable import-outside-toplevel (C0415) - imports are sometimes needed inside functions to avoid circular dependencies
# These match ruff's global ignores: E501 (line-too-long) and B008 (no pylint equivalent)
#
# Disable complexity metrics (R0911-R0915, R0902, R0904) - we use ruff C901 (McCabe cyclomatic complexity) instead
# Pylint's complexity metrics are different from ruff's cyclomatic complexity:
# - Ruff C901: Measures decision points (cyclomatic complexity) - industry standard, configurable
# - Pylint R0911-R0915: Measures counts (returns, branches, args, locals, statements) - not configurable
# See docs/LINTING_COMPLEXITY_ALIGNMENT.md for detailed explanation
