# MythosMUD — Agent instructions

MythosMUD is a Cthulhu Mythos-themed MUD (Multi-User Dungeon): Python/FastAPI/PostgreSQL backend, React/TypeScript
client, WebSocket real-time communication. The server is authoritative; use `make test` from the project root for
tests; follow security-first and COPPA requirements.

**Full project rules:** See `.cursor/rules/` for the complete, canonical rule set (Cursor Project Rules). For a
single-file consolidated reference usable outside Cursor, see the repo root [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
