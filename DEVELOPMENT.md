# üõ†Ô∏è MythosMUD ‚Äì Development Environment Setup

*"The proper setup of one's laboratory is as crucial to the pursuit of forbidden knowledge as the knowledge itself. Let us ensure our tools are both powerful and safe."*

This guide will help you bootstrap your workspace for developing MythosMUD, with particular emphasis on security, privacy, and COPPA compliance.

## üîí Security & Privacy First

### Critical Requirements
- **COPPA Compliance**: This project serves minors and must comply with Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule
- **Security-First Mindset**: All development decisions prioritize security over convenience
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations built into every feature
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only collect data absolutely necessary for gameplay
- **No Personal Information**: Never collect personal information from minors

### Development Security Checklist
- [ ] All secrets stored in environment variables (never hardcoded)
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Secure path validation for all file operations
- [ ] Rate limiting configured for all endpoints
- [ ] Security headers properly configured
- [ ] XSS protection implemented
- [ ] COPPA compliance verified for all features

---

## Prerequisites

- **Git**
- **Python 3.12+** (managed via [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) recommended)
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** (for client)
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (for Python dependency management - **required**)
- **VSCode** or Cursor.ai (recommended editor)
- **React Developer Tools** (Firefox/Chrome extension for debugging React components)

---

## 1. Install uv

**On macOS/Linux:**

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**On Windows:**

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Verify installation:**

```sh
uv --version
```

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

```sh
# Option 1: Clone with submodules in one command
git clone --recursive <your-repo-url>
cd MythosMUD
```

```sh
# Option 2: Clone first, then fetch submodules
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MythosMUD
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Note:** The `data/` directory is a git submodule containing world data. Make sure to fetch it using one of the methods above.

---

## 3. Set Up the Python Server

### a. Set Python Version (if using pyenv-win)

```sh
pyenv install 3.12.11  # if not already installed
pyenv local 3.12.11
```

### b. Install Dependencies

```sh
cd server
uv sync
```

### c. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

```sh
uv run pre-commit install -f
```

Semgrep is included in the pre-commit hooks. You can also run it manually:

```sh
make semgrep
```

### d. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/players/players.db

# Security Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-here

# COPPA Compliance Settings
COPPA_ENFORCED=true
MINOR_PROTECTION_ENABLED=true

# Development Settings
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DEBUG=false
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: Never commit the `.env` file to version control. Use `.env.example` for templates.

### e. Run the Server

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Always use the provided scripts for server management:

```powershell
# Stop any running server first
./scripts/stop_server.ps1

# Start the development server
./scripts/start_dev.ps1
```

The server should now be running at [http://localhost:54731](http://localhost:54731)

---

## 4. Set Up the React Client

### a. Install Dependencies

```sh
cd ../client
npm install
```

### b. Start the Development Server

```sh
npm start
```

The client should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## 5. Development Scripts

We provide convenient scripts for common development tasks:

### **Install Everything:**

```sh
python scripts/install.py
```

### **Run the Server:**

```sh
python scripts/run.py
```

### **Run Tests:**

```sh
python scripts/test.py
```

### **Lint Code:**

```sh
python scripts/lint.py
```

### **Format Code:**

```sh
python scripts/format.py
```

---

## 6. Manual Commands

### **Python Development:**

```sh
cd server

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run server (use scripts instead)
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Lint code
uv run ruff check .

# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Add new dependency
uv add package-name

# Add development dependency
uv add --dev package-name
```

### **Client Development:**

```sh
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 7. ü§ñ AI Agent Development Guidelines

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Start Session**: Review current tasks in `TASKS.local.md`
2. **Select Task**: Choose highest priority task from pending list
3. **Write Tests**: Create tests before implementing feature
4. **Implement**: Code the feature following security-first principles
5. **Test**: Run full test suite and ensure coverage
6. **Document**: Update documentation and `TASKS.local.md`
7. **Commit**: Commit changes with descriptive messages

### **Task Prioritization Framework**
When multiple tasks are pending, prioritize in this order:

1. **üî¥ Critical Security Issues** (Fix immediately)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Privacy compliance issues
   - Data protection problems

2. **üü° High Priority** (Complete within current session)
   - Core functionality bugs
   - Authentication/authorization issues
   - Critical user experience problems

3. **üü¢ Medium Priority** (Plan for next session)
   - Feature enhancements
   - Performance improvements
   - Code quality improvements

4. **üîµ Low Priority** (Nice to have)
   - UI/UX polish
   - Documentation improvements
   - Advanced features

### **Critical Rules for AI Agents**
- **Server Management**: ALWAYS use `./scripts/start_dev.ps1` and `./scripts/stop_server.ps1`
- **Database Placement**:
  - Production: `/data/players/` ONLY
  - Tests: `/server/tests/data/players/` ONLY
- **Testing**: Use `make test` from project root, maintain 80%+ coverage
- **Security**: Never hardcode secrets, always use environment variables
- **PowerShell**: Use PowerShell syntax, never bash-style `&&` for command chaining

---

## 8. Why uv?

- **üöÄ Faster**: 10-100x faster than pip/poetry
- **üîí Reliable**: Deterministic dependency resolution
- **üõ†Ô∏è Modern**: Built-in virtual environment management
- **üì¶ Compatible**: Works with existing pyproject.toml
- **üîÑ Simple**: Single tool for all Python operations

## 9. Troubleshooting

### **uv not found:**

```sh
# Reinstall uv following the installation instructions above
# Make sure to restart your terminal after installation
```

### **Python version issues:**

```sh
# Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed
python --version

# If using pyenv, set the local version
pyenv local 3.12.11
```

### **Dependency conflicts:**

```sh
# Clean and reinstall
cd server
uv sync --reinstall
```

### **Client-Server Connection Issues:**

```sh
# Check if server is running on correct port
curl http://localhost:54731/game/status

# Verify Vite proxy configuration in client/vite.config.ts
# Ensure target ports match server configuration

# Use React Developer Tools to debug component state
# - Install React Developer Tools extension in Firefox/Chrome
# - Check component props, state, and network requests
# - Monitor authentication state and API calls
```

### **React Component Debugging:**

- **React Developer Tools**: Use the Firefox/Chrome extension to inspect component state
- **Network Tab**: Check API requests and responses in browser dev tools
- **Console**: Monitor authentication flow and error messages
- **Component State**: Verify `isAuthenticated`, `playerId`, and `authToken` values

### **Security Issues:**

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all secrets are properly configured
- **Database Security**: Verify database files are in correct locations
- **Input Validation**: Check that all user inputs are properly validated
- **COPPA Compliance**: Verify no personal data is collected from minors
