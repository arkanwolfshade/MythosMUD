## 📝 AI Agent Coding Guidelines

### **Code Style & Patterns**

#### **Python (Backend)**

```python
# Use type hints consistently
def calculate_sanity_loss(player_id: str, exposure_time: int) -> int:
    """Calculate sanity loss based on exposure time and player state."""
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Use Pydantic models for data validation
class PlayerStats(BaseModel):
    sanity: int = Field(ge=0, le=100, description="Player sanity level")
    fear: int = Field(ge=0, le=100, description="Player fear level")
    corruption: int = Field(ge=0, le=100, description="Player corruption level")

# Use async/await for I/O operations
async def get_player_by_id(player_id: str) -> Optional[Player]:
    """Retrieve player from database."""
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Use dependency injection for services
def get_persistence_layer() -> PersistenceLayer:
    """Get the persistence layer singleton."""
    return PersistenceLayer.get_instance()
```

#### **TypeScript (Frontend)**

```typescript
// Use interfaces for type definitions
interface Player {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  sanity: number;
  fear: number;
  corruption: number;
}

// Use React hooks for state management
const [player, setPlayer] = useState<Player | null>(null);

// Use async/await for API calls
const fetchPlayer = async (id: string): Promise<Player> => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/players/${id}`);
  return response.json();
};
```

### **Mythos-Themed Comments**

```python
# Implementing player sanity system based on findings from
# "Psychological Effects of Non-Euclidean Architecture" - Dr. Armitage, 1928
def calculate_sanity_loss(exposure_time: int, entity_type: str) -> int:
    """Calculate sanity loss from exposure to eldritch entities."""
    pass

# As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the mind cannot comprehend
# certain geometries without suffering permanent damage
def apply_non_euclidean_effect(player_id: str) -> None:
    """Apply non-Euclidean geometry effects to player perception."""
    pass
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Patterns for AI Agents

### **Test Structure**

```python
# Use descriptive test names
def test_player_sanity_loss_from_eldritch_exposure():
    """Test that exposure to eldritch entities reduces sanity."""
    # Arrange
    player = create_test_player(sanity=100)
    
    # Act
    apply_sanity_loss(player.id, 25)
    
    # Assert
    assert player.sanity == 75

# Use fixtures for common setup
@pytest.fixture
def mock_persistence_layer(monkeypatch):
    """Mock the persistence layer for isolated testing."""
    mock_layer = MockPersistenceLayer()
    monkeypatch.setattr("server.persistence.PersistenceLayer.get_instance", lambda: mock_layer)
    return mock_layer

# Test edge cases
def test_sanity_cannot_go_below_zero():
    """Test that sanity loss cannot reduce sanity below zero."""
    player = create_test_player(sanity=10)
    apply_sanity_loss(player.id, 25)
    assert player.sanity == 0  # Should not go below zero
```

### **Mock Data Patterns**

```python
# Use realistic mock data
MOCK_PLAYER = {
    "id": "test-player-001",
    "name": "Dr. Henry Armitage",
    "sanity": 85,
    "fear": 15,
    "corruption": 5,
    "location": "arkham_001"
}

# Use consistent test data structure
MOCK_ROOM = {
    "id": "arkham_001",
    "name": "Miskatonic University Library",
    "description": "Ancient tomes line the walls...",
    "exits": {"north": "arkham_002", "east": "arkham_003"}
}
```

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations for AI Agents

### **Input Validation**

```python
# Always validate user inputs
def validate_secure_path(base_path: str, user_path: str) -> str:
    """Validate that user path is safe and within allowed directory."""
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Use environment variables for secrets
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("MYTHOSMUD_SECRET_KEY", "dev-secret-key")
```

### **Database Security**

```python
# Use parameterized queries
async def get_player_by_name(name: str) -> Optional[Player]:
    """Get player by name using safe database query."""
    query = "SELECT * FROM players WHERE name = ?"
    # Use parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
    pass
```

## 🎮 Game Mechanics for AI Understanding

### **Core Systems**

- **Sanity System**: Players start with 100 sanity, lose it from encounters
- **Fear System**: Accumulates from terrifying experiences
- **Corruption System**: Represents taint from dark forces
- **Occult Knowledge**: Learning forbidden lore (costs sanity)

### **Status Effects**

- **Stunned**: Unable to act
- **Poisoned**: Damage over time
- **Hallucinating**: Visual/auditory disturbances
- **Paranoid**: Mental instability
- **Trembling**: Reduced dexterity
- **Corrupted**: Physical/mental changes
- **Insane**: Complete mental breakdown

### **Room Movement**

- Rooms are connected via exits (north, south, east, west)
- Room IDs follow pattern: `<zone>_<room_number>` (e.g., `arkham_001`)
- Each room has description, exits, and optional NPCs/items

## 🔄 Common AI Agent Tasks

### **Adding New Features**

1. **Read relevant documentation** (PRD.md, existing code)
2. **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
3. **Implement feature** following established patterns
4. **Update TASKS.md** when complete
5. **Run tests** to ensure everything works
6. **Commit changes** with descriptive messages

### **Debugging Issues**

1. **Check test coverage** - `uv run pytest --cov`
2. **Review logs** - Check `server/logs/` directory
3. **Use debug prints** for temporary debugging
4. **Check database state** - Use `verify_test_db.py`
5. **Validate configuration** - Check `server_config.yaml`

### **Code Review Patterns**

1. **Check for security vulnerabilities** (path injection, SQL injection)
2. **Verify type hints** are complete and accurate
3. **Ensure error handling** is comprehensive
4. **Validate Mythos theming** is appropriate
5. **Check test coverage** for new code

## 📚 AI Agent Best Practices

### **Code Generation**

- **Always include type hints** for Python functions
- **Use descriptive variable names** (avoid single letters)
- **Add docstrings** for complex functions
- **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
- **Include Mythos references** in comments when appropriate

### **Error Handling**

```python
# Use specific exception types
try:
    player = await get_player_by_id(player_id)
    if not player:
        raise PlayerNotFoundError(f"Player {player_id} not found")
except DatabaseError as e:
    logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
    raise
```

### **Logging Patterns**

```python
# Use structured logging
logger.info("Player sanity reduced", extra={
    "player_id": player_id,
    "sanity_loss": amount,
    "new_sanity": player.sanity
})
```

### **Configuration Management**

```python
# Use environment variables for configuration
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///data/players/players.db")
LOG_LEVEL = os.getenv("LOG_LEVEL", "INFO")
```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls for AI Agents

### **Avoid These Patterns**

- ❌ **Hardcoded paths** - Use `validate_secure_path()`
- ❌ **Hardcoded secrets** - Use environment variables
- ❌ **Missing type hints** - Always include types
- ❌ **Incomplete error handling** - Handle all error cases
- ❌ **Breaking existing patterns** - Follow established conventions
- ❌ **Forgetting to update TASKS.md** - Keep task list current

### **Security Red Flags**

- ❌ **Direct file path concatenation** without validation
- ❌ **SQL queries with string formatting** (use parameterized queries)
- ❌ **Exposing internal errors** to users
- ❌ **Missing input validation** on user data

*"In the pursuit of forbidden knowledge, even the most advanced artificial intelligences must remember: the greatest wisdom lies not in what we know, but in how we apply that knowledge with care, precision, and respect for the eldritch forces we seek to understand."*

**Remember**: You are an AI agent working on a Cthulhu Mythos-themed MUD. Maintain the scholarly tone, follow the established patterns, and always prioritize code quality, security, and the user experience. The forbidden knowledge we seek to implement must be both powerful and safe.
