# MythosMUD Multiplayer Scenarios Playbook

## Overview

This playbook contains detailed scenarios for testing multiplayer functionality in MythosMUD. Each scenario should work correctly when run back-to-back without restarting the server or clients, ensuring proper state management and clean transitions between test cases.

## Test Players

- **ArkanWolfshade** (AW) - password: Cthulhu1
- **Ithaqua** - password: Cthulhu1
- **Default Room**: `earth_arkham_city_sanitarium_room_foyer_001` (Main Foyer)

## Scenario Validation Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Sequential Testing**: All scenarios must work back-to-back without server/client restarts
- ‚úÖ **Clean State Management**: No stale game state information between scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Message Isolation**: Players should only see messages relevant to current session
- ‚úÖ **Event Broadcasting**: Proper event-to-real-time bridge functionality
- ‚úÖ **Self-Message Exclusion**: Players should not see their own movement messages

4. **Ithaqua should NOT see any enters/leaves/entered/left messages**
   - Validates: Self-message exclusion and no stale game state

5. **Ithaqua leaves the game**
   - Expected: Ithaqua disconnects cleanly

6. **AW should see**: `"Ithaqua has left the game."`
   - Validates: Disconnection events are properly broadcast

### Technical Components Tested

3. **Self-Movement Messages**: Players see their own movement messages
4. **Mute Command Failure**: "An error occurred while processing your command"
5. **Event Ordering Issues**: Complex timing problems in event processing

**Root Cause Analysis Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Event broadcasting system audit - **DUPLICATE EVENT SYSTEMS**
- ‚úÖ Player service integration investigation - **MISSING APP STATE SERVICES**
- ‚úÖ Message persistence system overhaul - **STALE MESSAGE PERSISTENCE**

---

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

- ‚úÖ Event-to-Real-Time Bridge (`server/realtime/event_handler.py`)
- ‚úÖ Connection Manager (`server/realtime/connection_manager.py`)
- ‚úÖ WebSocket Handler (`server/realtime/websocket_handler.py`)
- ‚úÖ Client-side event handling (`client/src/components/GameTerminalWithPanels.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Room occupant tracking
- ‚úÖ `player_entered_game` and `player_left_game` events

### üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED (TESTING PAUSED)

**Root Cause Analysis Required:**

1. **Self-Movement Message Bug**: Players see their own movement messages
   - `exclude_player` logic not working correctly in movement broadcasts
   - Issue in `server/realtime/event_handler.py` movement handling
   - Affects both initial connection and regular movement

2. **Stale Message Persistence**: "X has left the game" messages persist on reconnection
   - Pending message clearing logic incomplete
   - Issue in `server/realtime/connection_manager.py` and `server/realtime/sse_handler.py`
   - Multiple attempts to fix have been insufficient

3. **Duplicate Message Issues**: Multiple "entered game" messages appearing
   - Event ordering and broadcast timing problems
   - Initial connection setup triggering unintended events

4. **Initial Connection Event Cascade**: Self-movement messages on first connect
   - `room.player_entered()` vs `room._players.add()` distinction not working
   - Connection setup in `server/realtime/websocket_handler.py` needs review

**Impact**: All multiplayer scenarios failing basic requirements

### Previous Known Issues (Less Critical)

- üîß Need better session isolation between scenarios

### Next Steps

1. Complete Scenario 2 fixes for clean game state
2. Implement Scenario 3 movement testing
3. Add comprehensive chat testing (Scenario 4)
4. Build automated test suite for all scenarios

## Development Notes

As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, "The boundaries between states must remain distinct, lest chaos seep through the dimensional barriers." Each scenario must maintain proper isolation while demonstrating the interconnected nature of the multiplayer system.

The multiplayer implementation represents a successful bridge between the event-driven backend architecture and the real-time client requirements, much like the dimensional gateways described in Wilmarth's Vermont correspondence - functional, but requiring careful management to prevent unwanted intrusions from previous sessions.

*"What has been tested once can be tested again, and with proper documentation, even madness becomes methodical."* - Dr. Armitage, 1928
