# MythosMUD Multiplayer Scenarios Playbook

## Overview

This playbook contains detailed scenarios for testing multiplayer functionality in MythosMUD. Each scenario should work correctly when run back-to-back without restarting the server or clients, ensuring proper state management and clean transitions between test cases.

## Test Players

- **ArkanWolfshade** (AW) - password: Cthulhu1
- **Ithaqua** - password: Cthulhu1

## Rules

- **Starting Room**: `earth_arkham_city_sanitarium_room_foyer_001` (Main Foyer) - update SQLite directly if necessary
- **Stop the client/server using stop_server.ps1**
- **Use Playwright MCP**
- **Use the credentials provided in this playbook**
- **ONLY USE start_dev.ps1**
- **The server and client ports are defined in** /server/server_config.yaml

## Scenario Validation Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Sequential Testing**: All scenarios must work back-to-back without server/client restarts
- ‚úÖ **Clean State Management**: No stale game state information between scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Message Isolation**: Players should only see messages relevant to current session
- ‚úÖ **Event Broadcasting**: Proper event-to-real-time bridge functionality
- ‚úÖ **Self-Message Exclusion**: Players should not see their own movement messages

#### Filtered Results

```
Players matching 'arka' (1): ArkanWolfshade [5] [ADMIN] - Arkham: City: Sanitarium Room Foyer 001
```

#### No Results

```
No players found matching 'xyz'. Try 'who' to see all online players.
```

#### No Online Players

```
No players are currently online.
```

### Room ID Format Parsing

The enhanced who command should properly parse room IDs like:

## Development Notes

As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, "The boundaries between states must remain distinct, lest chaos seep through the dimensional barriers." Each scenario must maintain proper isolation while demonstrating the interconnected nature of the multiplayer system.

The multiplayer implementation represents a successful bridge between the event-driven backend architecture and the real-time client requirements, much like the dimensional gateways described in Wilmarth's Vermont correspondence - functional, but requiring careful management to prevent unwanted intrusions from previous sessions.

*"What has been tested once can be tested again, and with proper documentation, even madness becomes methodical."* - Dr. Armitage, 1928
