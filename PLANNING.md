# üó∫Ô∏è MythosMUD ‚Äì Planning Document

This document outlines the vision, high-level architecture, technology stack, and required tools for the MythosMUD project.
If a decision is pending, it is marked as **TODO**.

---

## Vision

- Build a browser-accessible, text-based Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos.
- Focus on collaborative storytelling, exploration, and light horror combat.
- Make the codebase beginner-friendly for contributors and maintainers.
- Support persistent multiplayer gameplay with real-time interactions.
- Prioritize modularity, readability, and extensibility.

---

## Architecture

### High-Level Overview

- **Client (Front-End):**
  - Web-based terminal interface for text commands and output.
  - Features: command history, triggers, aliases, highlighting, ASCII navigation map.
  - Communicates with the server via WebSockets or similar real-time protocol.

- **Server (Back-End):**
  - Real-time, tick-based event loop.
  - Handles game logic, world state, combat, chat, and persistence.
  - Modular design for rooms, NPCs, combat, sanity, quests, etc.
  - Exposes APIs for client communication and admin tools.

- **Persistence Layer:**
  - Stores character data, world state, inventory, quest progress, and sanity.
  - Database choice: **SQLite for MVP, PostgreSQL or AWS DynamoDB preferred for production**.

- **Hosting/Deployment:**
  - Cloud-based, cost-optimized (AWS preferred).
  - SSL/TLS for secure connections.
  - Invite-only authentication.

## üèõÔ∏è Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

*As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, a thorough examination of our eldritch artifacts has revealed both strengths and areas requiring immediate attention.*

### **Architectural Assessment: 7.5/10** ‚úÖ

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Excellent real-time communication design (SSE + WebSocket hybrid)
- Proper use of FastAPI dependency injection
- Good data persistence patterns with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Comprehensive test coverage (88% - exceeds 70% requirement)
- Thread-safe singleton pattern for persistence layer
- Event-driven architecture with proper pub/sub system

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Single Responsibility Principle Violations** - Large files with multiple responsibilities
2. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Hardcoded secrets and missing rate limiting
3. **Architectural Inconsistencies** - Mixed abstraction levels in API endpoints
4. **Performance Concerns** - Memory usage in EventBus and database connection pooling
5. **Code Quality Issues** - Some functions exceed complexity limits

### **Security Analysis**

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- Hardcoded secrets in `server/auth/users.py` (line 90)
- Missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Overly permissive CORS configuration for production
- Authentication tokens logged in plain text

**Medium Risk Issues:**
- Error information disclosure in some endpoints
- Incomplete input sanitization
- Missing security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

### **Code Quality Metrics**

**Positive Indicators:**
- Test Coverage: 88% ‚úÖ (Excellent)
- Line Length Compliance: 120 chars max ‚úÖ
- Good documentation and README files
- Proper logging implementation
- Comprehensive test suite (669 passed, 3 skipped)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some functions exceed recommended complexity limits
- Code duplication in player data conversion
- Long files (command_handler.py: 711 lines, persistence.py: 364 lines)
- Missing type hints in some functions

### **Technical Debt Assessment**

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Security Hardening** - Move hardcoded secrets to environment variables
2. **Architecture Refactoring** - Split large files into focused modules
3. **Rate Limiting Implementation** - Add protection against abuse
4. **Error Handling Standardization** - Implement consistent patterns

**Short-term Improvements (1-2 weeks):**
1. **Service Layer Enhancement** - Create dedicated service classes
2. **API Consistency** - Standardize response formats and error handling
3. **Input Validation** - Enhance security validation patterns
4. **Performance Optimization** - Add database connection pooling

**Long-term Refactoring (1-2 months):**
1. **Microservices Preparation** - Prepare for future scaling
2. **Event Sourcing Implementation** - Use events for state changes
3. **CQRS Pattern** - Separate read/write operations
4. **Advanced Monitoring** - Implement comprehensive metrics

### **Complexity Hotspots**

**High Complexity Functions:**
- `command_handler.py` (711 lines) - Multiple responsibilities
- `persistence.py` (364 lines) - Too many responsibilities
- `main.py` - Mixed concerns (app creation + route definitions)

**Recommended Refactoring:**
- Split command_handler.py into focused modules (commands/, services/)
- Extract persistence logic into domain-specific repositories
- Create dedicated service layer for business logic
- Implement proper dependency injection patterns

### **Performance & Scalability Analysis**

**Current Performance Metrics:**
- **Test Coverage**: 88% ‚úÖ (Excellent)
- **Code Quality**: Good with ruff linting
- **Database**: SQLite for MVP (appropriate)

**Scalability Concerns:**
1. **Memory Usage**: EventBus keeps all events in memory
2. **Database**: SQLite will become bottleneck with concurrent users
3. **Connection Management**: No connection pooling for database

**Recommended Improvements:**
1. Implement database connection pooling
2. Add Redis for session management
3. Consider PostgreSQL for production
4. Implement caching layer for room data

## Next Phase Priorities

### **Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate - This Week)**
1. **Security Hardening** - Move remaining secrets to environment variables
2. **Architecture Refactoring** - Split large files into focused modules
3. **Rate Limiting Implementation** - Add protection against abuse
4. **Error Handling Standardization** - Implement consistent patterns

### **Phase 1.5: User Management System (COMPLETED)** ‚úÖ
*As noted in the restricted archives of Miskatonic University, the user management system has been successfully implemented and tested, providing comprehensive muting capabilities and admin privileges.*

#### **User Management System Status: 100% Complete** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Player Muting**: Personal mute functionality (player A mutes player B)
- ‚úÖ **Global Muting**: Admin-only global mute functionality
- ‚úÖ **Mute Persistence**: JSON file-based persistence per player
- ‚úÖ **Admin System**: Database-based admin status persistence
- ‚úÖ **Mute Commands**: `mute`, `unmute`, `mutes` commands implemented
- ‚úÖ **Privacy Protection**: Players cannot see who has muted them
- ‚úÖ **Server-Side Filtering**: Messages filtered on server before client delivery
- ‚úÖ **Real-Time Testing**: Verified with Playwright MCP using three players
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: All linting issues resolved, tests passing

#### **Completed Features**

**Mute System:**
- Personal mutes: Player A can mute Player B (only affects Player A's view)
- Global mutes: Admins can globally mute players (affects all non-admin players)
- Mute persistence: Stored in individual JSON files per player
- Mute commands: `mute <player>`, `unmute <player>`, `mutes` (view own mutes)
- Privacy protection: Players cannot see if they are muted by others

**Admin System:**
- Admin status stored in database (`is_admin` field)
- Admin privileges for global muting
- Admin status persistence across sessions

**Testing & Quality:**
- Comprehensive Playwright MCP testing with three players
- All linting issues resolved (ruff compliance)
- Test coverage maintained at 80%+
- Real-time functionality verified end-to-end

#### **Technical Implementation**

**Key Components:**
- `UserManager`: Core service for mute management and persistence
- `ChatService`: Interface between commands and UserManager
- `NatsMessageHandler`: Server-side message filtering
- JSON file persistence: Individual files per player for mute data
- Database integration: Admin status in players table

**Message Flow:**
```
1. Player A sends: "say Hello everyone!"
2. Server processes command ‚Üí Creates ChatMessage
3. Server filters message based on mute status
4. Message sent only to unmuted players in room
5. Players receive filtered messages via WebSocket
```

#### **Testing Results (2025-08-15)**

**Three-Player Test Scenario:**
- **Players**: ArkanWolfshade, Ithaqua, Azathoth
- **Test**: ArkanWolfshade mutes Ithaqua, verifies Azathoth can still see Ithaqua's messages
- **Results**: ‚úÖ All functionality working correctly
