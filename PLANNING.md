# üó∫Ô∏è MythosMUD ‚Äì Planning Document

This document outlines the vision, high-level architecture, technology stack, and required tools for the MythosMUD project.
If a decision is pending, it is marked as **TODO**.

---

## Vision

- Build a browser-accessible, text-based Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos.
- Focus on collaborative storytelling, exploration, and light horror combat.
- Make the codebase beginner-friendly for contributors and maintainers.
- Support persistent multiplayer gameplay with real-time interactions.
- Prioritize modularity, readability, and extensibility.

---

## Architecture

### High-Level Overview

- **Client (Front-End):**
  - Web-based terminal interface for text commands and output.
  - Features: command history, triggers, aliases, highlighting, ASCII navigation map.
  - Communicates with the server via WebSockets or similar real-time protocol.

- **Server (Back-End):**
  - Real-time, tick-based event loop.
  - Handles game logic, world state, combat, chat, and persistence.
  - Modular design for rooms, NPCs, combat, sanity, quests, etc.
  - Exposes APIs for client communication and admin tools.

- **Persistence Layer:**
  - Stores character data, world state, inventory, quest progress, and sanity.
  - Database choice: **SQLite for MVP, PostgreSQL or AWS DynamoDB preferred for production**.

- **Hosting/Deployment:**
  - Cloud-based, cost-optimized (AWS preferred).
  - SSL/TLS for secure connections.
  - Invite-only authentication.

## üèõÔ∏è Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

*As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, a thorough examination of our eldritch artifacts has revealed both strengths and areas requiring immediate attention.*

### **Architectural Assessment: 7.5/10** ‚úÖ

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Excellent real-time communication design (SSE + WebSocket hybrid)
- Proper use of FastAPI dependency injection
- Good data persistence patterns with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Comprehensive test coverage (88% - exceeds 70% requirement)
- Thread-safe singleton pattern for persistence layer
- Event-driven architecture with proper pub/sub system

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Single Responsibility Principle Violations** - Large files with multiple responsibilities
2. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Hardcoded secrets and missing rate limiting
3. **Architectural Inconsistencies** - Mixed abstraction levels in API endpoints
4. **Performance Concerns** - Memory usage in EventBus and database connection pooling
5. **Code Quality Issues** - Some functions exceed complexity limits

### **Security Analysis**

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- Hardcoded secrets in `server/auth/users.py` (line 90)
- Missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Overly permissive CORS configuration for production
- Authentication tokens logged in plain text

**Medium Risk Issues:**
- Error information disclosure in some endpoints
- Incomplete input sanitization
- Missing security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

### **Code Quality Metrics**

**Positive Indicators:**
- Test Coverage: 88% ‚úÖ (Excellent)
- Line Length Compliance: 120 chars max ‚úÖ
- Good documentation and README files
- Proper logging implementation
- Comprehensive test suite (669 passed, 3 skipped)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some functions exceed recommended complexity limits
- Code duplication in player data conversion
- Long files (command_handler.py: 711 lines, persistence.py: 364 lines)
- Missing type hints in some functions

### **Technical Debt Assessment**

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Security Hardening** - Move hardcoded secrets to environment variables
2. **Architecture Refactoring** - Split large files into focused modules
3. **Rate Limiting Implementation** - Add protection against abuse
4. **Error Handling Standardization** - Implement consistent patterns

**Short-term Improvements (1-2 weeks):**
1. **Service Layer Enhancement** - Create dedicated service classes
2. **API Consistency** - Standardize response formats and error handling
3. **Input Validation** - Enhance security validation patterns
4. **Performance Optimization** - Add database connection pooling

**Long-term Refactoring (1-2 months):**
1. **Microservices Preparation** - Prepare for future scaling
2. **Event Sourcing Implementation** - Use events for state changes
3. **CQRS Pattern** - Separate read/write operations
4. **Advanced Monitoring** - Implement comprehensive metrics

### **Complexity Hotspots**

**High Complexity Functions:**
- `command_handler.py` (711 lines) - Multiple responsibilities
- `persistence.py` (364 lines) - Too many responsibilities
- `main.py` - Mixed concerns (app creation + route definitions)

**Recommended Refactoring:**
- Split command_handler.py into focused modules (commands/, services/)
- Extract persistence logic into domain-specific repositories
- Create dedicated service layer for business logic
- Implement proper dependency injection patterns

### **Performance & Scalability Analysis**

**Current Performance Metrics:**
- **Test Coverage**: 88% ‚úÖ (Excellent)
- **Code Quality**: Good with ruff linting
- **Database**: SQLite for MVP (appropriate)

**Scalability Concerns:**
1. **Memory Usage**: EventBus keeps all events in memory
2. **Database**: SQLite will become bottleneck with concurrent users
3. **Connection Management**: No connection pooling for database

**Recommended Improvements:**
1. Implement database connection pooling
2. Add Redis for session management
3. Consider PostgreSQL for production
4. Implement caching layer for room data
