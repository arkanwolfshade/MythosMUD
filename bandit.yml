# Bandit configuration for Codacy
# This file configures Bandit to skip B101 (assert_used) checks only in test files
# Assert statements are standard and expected in test files (pytest uses them extensively)
# but should still be flagged in production code for security reasons

# Configure assert_used plugin to skip B101 checks only for test files
# This keeps B101 enabled for production code while allowing assert statements in tests
assert_used:
  skips:
    - '*/test_*.py'     # Matches test_*.py files at any directory depth (e.g., server/tests/unit/services/test_models.py)
    - '*_test.py'       # Matches *_test.py files (alternative naming convention)
    - '*/tests/*.py'    # Matches all Python files directly in tests directories (e.g., server/tests/conftest.py)

# Note: B101 will remain enabled for production code files to catch inappropriate
# use of assert statements that would be removed in optimized byte code.
