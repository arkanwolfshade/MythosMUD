# legacy-peer-deps: Required for React 19 compatibility with @xstate/react v4
# @xstate/react v4 declares peer dependency on React ^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0
# but works correctly with React 19.x. This flag allows npm to proceed with the
# installation without failing on peer dependency mismatches.
#
# Note: This should be removed once @xstate/react v5 is released with React 19 support
# or when we migrate away from XState.
