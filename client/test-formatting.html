        Arkham Town Square You are standing in the bustling heart of Arkham. The Miskatonic River flows nearby, its dark
        waters reflecting the ancient buildings that line its banks. Merchants hawk their wares from colorful stalls,

        the distance, you hear the faint sound of pages turning, though you are quite certain you are alone in this
        section. Exits: east
