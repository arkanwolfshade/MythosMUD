# Connection Termination Implementation Demo

## 🏛️ MythosMUD Connection Termination Behavior

**Professor Wolfshade, here's a demonstration of the connection termination implementation that ensures subsequent successful connections terminate previous connections entirely.**

## 🔧 Implementation Overview

### **Before (Problematic Behavior):**
- Multiple WebSocket connections could exist simultaneously for the same user
- New connections would overwrite previous ones without proper cleanup
- Resource leaks and inconsistent state
- Security vulnerabilities from multiple active sessions

### **After (Proper Behavior):**
- Only one active real-time connection per user
- Previous connections are properly terminated when new ones are established
- Complete cleanup of session state and resources
- Secure single-session-per-user model

## 📋 Code Changes Made

### **1. Enhanced Connection Manager (`server/realtime/connection_manager.py`)**

#### **New Method: `force_disconnect_player()`**
```python
async def force_disconnect_player(self, player_id: str):
    """
    Force disconnect a player from all connections (WebSocket and SSE).
    This is used when a new connection is established for the same player.
    """
    try:
        logger.info(f"Force disconnecting player {player_id} from all connections")

        # Disconnect WebSocket if active
        if player_id in self.player_websockets:
            await self.disconnect_websocket(player_id)

        # Disconnect SSE if active
        if player_id in self.active_sse_connections:
            self.disconnect_sse(player_id)

        logger.info(f"Player {player_id} force disconnected from all connections")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error force disconnecting player {player_id}: {e}", exc_info=True)
```

#### **Enhanced WebSocket Connection Logic**
```python
async def connect_websocket(self, websocket: WebSocket, player_id: str) -> bool:
    try:
        logger.info(f"Attempting to accept WebSocket for player {player_id}")

        # Check if player already has an active connection and terminate it
        if player_id in self.player_websockets or player_id in self.active_sse_connections:
            logger.info(f"Player {player_id} has existing connection, terminating it")
            await self.force_disconnect_player(player_id)

        await websocket.accept()
        logger.info(f"WebSocket accepted for player {player_id}")

        # ... rest of connection logic
```

#### **Enhanced SSE Connection Logic**
```python
def connect_sse(self, player_id: str) -> str:
    # Check if player already has an active connection and terminate it
    if player_id in self.player_websockets or player_id in self.active_sse_connections:
        logger.info(f"Player {player_id} has existing connection, terminating it")
        # Use async version if we're in an async context
        try:
            import asyncio
            loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
            loop.create_task(self.force_disconnect_player(player_id))
        except RuntimeError:
            # No running loop, run synchronously
            import asyncio
            asyncio.run(self.force_disconnect_player(player_id))

    connection_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    self.active_sse_connections[player_id] = connection_id
    logger.info(f"SSE connected for player {player_id}")
```

#### **Proper WebSocket Closure**
```python
async def disconnect_websocket(self, player_id: str):
    try:
        if player_id in self.player_websockets:
            connection_id = self.player_websockets[player_id]
            if connection_id in self.active_websockets:
                websocket = self.active_websockets[connection_id]
                # Properly close the WebSocket connection
                try:
                    await websocket.close(code=1000, reason="New connection established")
                except Exception as e:
                    logger.warning(f"Error closing WebSocket for {player_id}: {e}")
                del self.active_websockets[connection_id]
            del self.player_websockets[player_id]
```

## 🎯 Behavior Demonstration

### **Scenario: User logs in twice**

1. **First Login:**
   - User establishes WebSocket connection
   - Connection stored in `player_websockets[player_id]`
   - User can interact with the game

2. **Second Login (Same User):**
   - System detects existing connection for `player_id`
   - Calls `force_disconnect_player(player_id)`
   - Previous WebSocket is properly closed with reason "New connection established"
   - All session state is cleaned up (room subscriptions, rate limiting, etc.)
   - New connection is established with fresh state

3. **Result:**
   - Only one active connection per user
   - Previous connection is completely terminated
   - No resource leaks or state conflicts

## 🔒 Security & User Experience Benefits

### **Security:**
- ✅ Prevents multiple active sessions per user
- ✅ Eliminates session hijacking vulnerabilities
- ✅ Ensures consistent authentication state

### **User Experience:**
- ✅ Eliminates confusion from multiple concurrent sessions
- ✅ Prevents actions from one session affecting another
- ✅ Ensures fresh state for each new connection

### **Resource Management:**
- ✅ Prevents connection leaks
- ✅ Proper cleanup of WebSocket resources
- ✅ Efficient memory usage

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Manual Testing:**
1. Open browser and log in to MythosMUD
2. Open second browser tab/window and log in with same credentials
3. First session should be terminated
4. Only second session should be active

### **Automated Testing:**
- WebSocket connection termination tests
- SSE connection termination tests
- State cleanup verification
- Resource leak detection

## 📊 Expected Log Output

When a user logs in a second time, you should see logs like:

```
INFO: Player testuser has existing connection, terminating it
INFO: Force disconnecting player testuser from all connections
INFO: WebSocket disconnected for player testuser
INFO: Player testuser force disconnected from all connections
INFO: WebSocket accepted for player testuser
INFO: WebSocket connected for player testuser
```

## 🎉 Summary

**The implementation now properly ensures that:**
- ✅ Subsequent successful connections terminate previous connections entirely
- ✅ Only one active real-time connection per user
- ✅ Proper cleanup of all session state and resources
- ✅ Secure single-session-per-user model
- ✅ Enhanced user experience with consistent state

**This is the correct behavior for a MUD system where users should only have one active connection at a time.**
