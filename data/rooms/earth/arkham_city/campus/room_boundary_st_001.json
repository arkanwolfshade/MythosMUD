  "description": "A cobblestone street that marks the edge of Miskatonic University's campus. Gothic spires loom overhead, their shadows stretching across the pavement like grasping fingers. The air here carries the faint scent of old books and something more arcane. Students hurry past with their heads down, clutching leather-bound tomes that seem to whisper secrets to those who listen too closely.",
