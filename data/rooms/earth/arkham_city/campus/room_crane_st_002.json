  "description": "The eastern section of Crane Street, dominated by the imposing facade of the university library. The building's stone walls seem to absorb light rather than reflect it, and the gargoyles perched on the roof appear to shift position when no one is looking directly at them. The street is quiet here, save for the rustling of pages and the whispered conversations of researchers who have ventured too deep into the restricted sections.",
