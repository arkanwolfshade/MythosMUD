  "name": "Peabody Avenue - Downtown Section",
  "description": "A bustling section of Peabody Avenue in downtown Arkham, filled with shops, banks, and restaurants that reflect the constant activity of city life. The street is wide and well-maintained, with modern storefronts interspersed with older buildings that have been converted to commercial use. The air carries the mingled scents of commerce, coffee, and the faint aroma of something more arcane that lingers just beneath the surface of everyday business.",
