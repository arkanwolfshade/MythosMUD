  "name": "W. Pickman Street - Dangerous Quarter",
  "description": "A narrow, winding street in the most dangerous district of Arkham, where the city's criminal element mingles with practitioners of forbidden arts. The buildings here seem to lean inward as if trying to hide their secrets, and the shadows are deeper than they should be. The cobblestones are uneven and cracked, and the air carries the scent of decay mingled with something sweet and cloying that suggests deals being made that would make a sane person's blood run cold.",
