  "name": "E. Pickman Street - Merchant Quarter",
  "description": "A commercial street in the merchant district where the buildings seem to shift and change when viewed from the corner of one's eye. The street is lined with shops and market stalls, their facades decorated with signs that seem to whisper secrets to those who read them too closely. The air carries the mingled scents of exotic spices, old books, and something more arcane that suggests the merchants here deal in more than just ordinary goods.",
