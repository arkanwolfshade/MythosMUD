  "name": "W. Curwen Street - Near High Lane",
  "description": "The western section of W. Curwen Street where it meets High Lane. Victorian houses with steep gables and narrow windows line both sides, their dark facades broken only by the occasional flicker of candlelight behind drawn curtains. The cobblestones are worn smooth by countless footsteps, and the air carries the faint scent of old wood and something more sinister that lingers just beyond perception.",
