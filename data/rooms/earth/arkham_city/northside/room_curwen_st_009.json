  "description": "A residential section of W. Curwen Street where the houses seem to watch you pass with a malevolent patience. The street is lined with wrought-iron fences surrounding neglected gardens where twisted rose bushes claw at the air with thorny fingers. The shadows here are deeper than they should be, and the sound of your footsteps echoes strangely against the silent facades.",
