  "name": "W. Curwen Street - Near Brown Street",
  "description": "A section of W. Curwen Street where the residential district takes on an even more foreboding character. The houses here seem to lean away from the street as if repelled by some unseen force, their windows reflecting the dim light in ways that suggest movement within. The cobblestones are uneven and cracked, and the air carries the faint scent of something that might be incense or might be something far worse.",
