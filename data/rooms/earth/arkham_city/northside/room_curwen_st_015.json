  "description": "The easternmost section of W. Curwen Street where the residential district takes on its most foreboding character. The houses here seem to watch you pass with a malevolent patience, their dark facades broken only by the occasional flicker of candlelight behind drawn curtains. The cobblestones are uneven and cracked, and the air carries the faint scent of something that might be incense or might be something far worse.",
