  "name": "W. Curwen Street - Northern Section",
  "description": "A northern section of W. Curwen Street where the residential district begins to transition toward the downtown area. The houses here have a slightly more commercial character, with some converted to small shops and offices. The cobblestones are well-worn from the increased foot traffic, and the air carries the mingled scents of old wood, coffee, and something more arcane that lingers just beyond perception.",
