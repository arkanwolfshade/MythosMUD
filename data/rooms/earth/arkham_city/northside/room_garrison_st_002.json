  "name": "N. Garrison Street - Northern Section",
  "description": "A northern section of N. Garrison Street where the residential district takes on a slightly more imposing character. The houses here are larger and more stately, with wrought-iron fences and manicured gardens that seem to hide secrets of their own. The cobblestones are well-maintained, and the air carries the faint scent of roses and something more arcane that lingers just beyond perception.",
