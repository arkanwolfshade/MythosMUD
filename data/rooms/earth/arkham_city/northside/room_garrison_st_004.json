  "name": "N. Garrison Street - Southern Section",
  "description": "A southern section of N. Garrison Street where the residential district begins to transition toward the downtown area. The houses here have a slightly more commercial character, with some converted to small businesses and professional offices. The cobblestones are well-worn from the increased foot traffic, and the air carries the mingled scents of old wood, coffee, and something more arcane.",
