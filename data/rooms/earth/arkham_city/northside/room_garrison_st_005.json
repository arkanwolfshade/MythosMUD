  "description": "The southernmost section of N. Garrison Street where the residential district gives way to the bustling commercial heart of Arkham. The street widens here, and the buildings take on a more urban character with storefronts and offices. The cobblestones are well-maintained, and the air carries the mingled scents of commerce, coffee, and the constant activity of city life.",
