  "name": "High Lane - Northern End",
  "description": "The northernmost stretch of High Lane, where the cobblestone street narrows and the ancient oaks grow thickest. Their gnarled branches intertwine overhead, creating a natural canopy that filters the light into eerie patterns. The houses here are the oldest in the district, their weathered facades bearing witness to generations of whispered secrets. Shadows dance along the walls, moving with a rhythm that seems independent of any breeze.",
