  "name": "High Lane - Derby Intersection South",
  "description": "The southern approach to the W. Derby Street intersection on High Lane. The cobblestone street is well-worn here, with deep grooves that seem to lead inexorably toward the crossroads. The ancient oaks cast long shadows that stretch across the street like grasping fingers. The houses here seem to recoil from the intersection, their windows dark and their doors tightly shut. An air of anticipation hangs heavy in the atmosphere.",
