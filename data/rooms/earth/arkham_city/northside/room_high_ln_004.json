  "name": "High Lane - Middle Section",
  "description": "A quiet stretch of High Lane between the major intersections. The cobblestone street narrows here, creating an intimate passage between rows of weathered houses. The ancient oaks grow close to the street, their branches forming a natural archway overhead. The shadows here are deepest, and the air carries the faint scent of old wood and damp earth. The houses seem to lean inward, as if sharing whispered conversations across the narrow street.",
