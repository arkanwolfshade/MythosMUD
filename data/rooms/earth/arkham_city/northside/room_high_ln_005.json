  "name": "High Lane - Southern Middle",
  "description": "Another section of High Lane's middle stretch, where the street maintains its narrow, intimate character. The cobblestones here are uneven, worn down by generations of foot traffic. The ancient oaks continue their silent vigil, their branches creating shifting patterns of light and shadow on the street below. The houses here are particularly old, their facades bearing the marks of time and weather. Some windows glow with a faint, flickering light that seems to pulse with an otherworldly rhythm.",
