  "name": "Gedney Street - Residential Quarter",
  "description": "A quiet residential street where the houses seem to huddle together for protection against something unseen. The street is narrow and winding, lined with Victorian architecture that seems to lean inward as if trying to hide its secrets. The cobblestones are worn smooth by countless footsteps, and the air carries the faint scent of old wood and something more sinister that lingers just beyond the threshold of perception.",
