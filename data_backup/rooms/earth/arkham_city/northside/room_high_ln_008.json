  "name": "High Lane - Southern End",
  "description": "The southernmost stretch of High Lane, where the cobblestone street narrows once more as it approaches the edge of the northside district. The ancient oaks grow thick here, their branches creating a natural barrier that seems to mark the boundary of this mysterious neighborhood. The houses here are the most isolated, their weathered facades bearing witness to the passage of time. Shadows dance along the walls with an otherworldly rhythm, and the air carries the faint scent of old secrets and whispered legends.",
