# Admin Teleport Feature Requirements Document

## Overview

The Admin Teleport feature allows administrators to instantly move players between locations in the MUD, bypassing normal movement restrictions and providing powerful moderation tools.

## Feature Description

As an admin, I should be able to teleport any online player to my location or teleport myself to any online player's location using simple chat commands.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Authentication & Authorization
- **Requirement**: Only users with admin role in the database can use teleport commands
- **Implementation**: Check user's role field in the database before allowing teleport commands
- **Validation**: Reject commands from non-admin users with appropriate error message

### FR-2: Command Interface
- **Requirement**: Two primary commands:
  - `/teleport <display_name>` - Bring target player to admin's location
  - `/goto <display_name>` - Move admin to target player's location
- **Implementation**: Parse commands in chat system, validate admin status, then execute teleport logic

### FR-3: Target Selection
- **Requirement**: Target players by their display name
- **Implementation**: Look up online players by display name
- **Validation**: Return error if target player is not found or not online

### FR-4: Confirmation System
- **Requirement**: Admin must confirm teleport action before execution
- **Implementation**: Send confirmation prompt to admin after command is issued
- **UI**: Display confirmation message with target player name and action type

### FR-5: Player Notification
- **Requirement**: Target player must be notified when being teleported
- **Implementation**: Send notification message to target player before teleport
- **Message**: Inform player they are being teleported by admin

### FR-6: Cross-Zone Teleportation
- **Requirement**: Teleportation works across all zones and planes without restrictions
- **Implementation**: Bypass normal movement validation and zone restrictions
- **Database**: Update player location in database regardless of zone boundaries

### FR-7: Error Handling
- **Requirement**: Graceful failure when target player goes offline during teleport
- **Implementation**: Check player online status before executing teleport
- **Message**: Inform admin of failure reason (player offline, not found, etc.)

### FR-8: Restricted Area Access
- **Requirement**: Admins can teleport to players in restricted areas
- **Implementation**: Bypass area access restrictions for admin teleportation
- **Validation**: Allow teleport even if normal movement would be blocked

### FR-9: Database Persistence
- **Requirement**: All teleport actions must persist to database
- **Implementation**: Update player location records in database
- **Validation**: Ensure location changes are saved before completing teleport

### FR-10: Visual Effects
- **Requirement**: Teleportation should have visible effects for other players
- **Implementation**: Display teleport effect messages to players in both source and destination rooms
- **Message**: Show arrival/departure effects for dramatic impact

### FR-11: Audit Logging
- **Requirement**: All teleport actions logged to admin actions log
- **Implementation**: Log teleport events with timestamp, admin, target, and action type
- **Data**: Include source and destination locations for audit trail

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- **Requirement**: Teleport commands should execute within 1 second
- **Implementation**: Optimize player lookup and database updates
- **Monitoring**: Track command execution time

### NFR-2: Security
- **Requirement**: Prevent unauthorized access to teleport functionality
- **Implementation**: Server-side validation of admin role
- **Audit**: Log all access attempts for security monitoring

### NFR-3: Reliability
- **Requirement**: Teleport commands should be atomic operations
- **Implementation**: Use database transactions for location updates
- **Recovery**: Rollback changes if teleport fails partway through

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema
- **Player Table**: Ensure `role` field exists for admin identification
- **Location Tracking**: Update player location records
- **Audit Table**: Create admin_actions_log table for teleport events

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/admin/teleport` - Execute teleport command
- `GET /api/admin/online-players` - List online players for admin reference

### Message Format
```json
{
  "command": "teleport|goto",
  "target_player": "display_name",
  "admin_id": "admin_user_id",
  "confirmation_required": true
}
```

## User Stories

### US-1: Admin Teleports Player to Location
**As an** admin
**I want to** teleport a player to my current location
**So that** I can assist them or move them to a safe area

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can use `/teleport <display_name>` command
- System confirms action before execution
- Target player is notified of teleport
- Player appears in admin's location
- Other players see teleport effect
- Action is logged for audit

### US-2: Admin Teleports to Player Location
**As an** admin
**I want to** teleport to a player's location
**So that** I can investigate issues or provide assistance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can use `/goto <display_name>` command
- System confirms action before execution
- Admin appears in target player's location
- Other players see teleport effect
- Action is logged for audit

### US-3: Error Handling
**As an** admin
**I want to** receive clear error messages when teleport fails
**So that** I understand why the action didn't complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clear error message for offline players
- Clear error message for non-existent players
- Clear error message for permission issues
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Add admin role validation to command system
2. Create teleport command parser
3. Implement player lookup by display name
4. Add confirmation system

### Phase 2: Teleport Logic
1. Implement location update logic
2. Add cross-zone teleportation support
3. Create visual effects system
4. Implement player notification

### Phase 3: Database & Logging
1. Create admin actions log table
2. Implement audit logging
3. Add database transaction support
4. Create admin API endpoints

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish
1. Unit tests for all teleport functions
2. Integration tests for admin workflow
3. Performance testing
4. Security testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Database Consistency**: Teleport failures could leave players in invalid states
- **Mitigation**: Use database transactions and rollback on failure

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Player lookup by display name could be slow with many online players
- **Mitigation**: Index display names and implement caching

### Low Risk
- **User Experience**: Confirmation prompts might slow down emergency responses
- **Mitigation**: Consider optional "emergency mode" for trusted admins

## Success Metrics

- **Functionality**: 100% of teleport commands execute successfully
- **Performance**: Average teleport time < 1 second
- **Reliability**: 0% data corruption from teleport operations
- **Security**: 0% unauthorized teleport attempts succeed

## Future Enhancements

- **Bulk Teleport**: Teleport multiple players at once
- **Teleport History**: View recent teleport actions
- **Teleport Restrictions**: Limit teleport frequency or destinations
- **Emergency Override**: Bypass confirmation for emergency situations
- **Teleport Zones**: Define safe zones for teleportation
