# Agent OS Implementation for MythosMUD

## Overview

We have successfully implemented [Agent OS](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os) for the MythosMUD project, providing a structured framework for AI agent development and project management.

## What is Agent OS?

Agent OS is a system for better planning and executing software development tasks with AI agents. It provides:

- **Structured Workflows**: Templates for planning, spec creation, task execution, and analysis
- **Development Standards**: Consistent coding standards and best practices
- **Command Templates**: Pre-built commands for common development tasks
- **Cursor Integration**: Rules that work directly in Cursor IDE
- **Claude Code Support**: Commands and agents for Claude Code

## Implementation Details

### Base Installation

The Agent OS base installation is located at `.agent-os/` in the project root and includes:

- **Instructions**: Core and meta instructions for AI agents
- **Standards**: Development standards and best practices
- **Commands**: Command templates for various tasks
- **Configuration**: Agent OS configuration file

### Project Installation

Agent OS has been installed into the MythosMUD project with:

- **Cursor Rules**: Available as `@` commands in Cursor
- **Claude Code Commands**: Available as `/` commands in Claude Code
- **Project-specific Instructions**: Tailored for MythosMUD development

## Available Commands

### Cursor Commands (use `@` prefix)

- `@plan-product` - Set the mission & roadmap for a new product
- `@analyze-product` - Set up the mission and roadmap for an existing product
- `@create-spec` - Create a spec for a new feature
- `@execute-tasks` - Build and ship code for a new feature

### Claude Code Commands (use `/` prefix)

- `/plan-product` - Set the mission & roadmap for a new product
- `/analyze-product` - Set up the mission and roadmap for an existing product
- `/create-spec` - Create a spec for a new feature
- `/execute-tasks` - Build and ship code for a new feature

## Installation Scripts

We created PowerShell equivalents of the original bash scripts:

### Base Installation
```powershell
.\scripts\agent_os_setup.ps1 -Cursor
```

### Project Installation
```powershell
.\scripts\install_agent_os_project.ps1 -Cursor
```

## Benefits for MythosMUD

1. **Structured Development**: Consistent approach to feature planning and implementation
2. **AI Agent Optimization**: Better AI agent performance with structured workflows
3. **Documentation Standards**: Consistent documentation and specification creation
4. **Cursor Integration**: Seamless integration with our primary development environment
5. **MythosMUD Alignment**: Can be customized to align with our Cthulhu Mythos theme

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Standards**: Adapt the standards to match MythosMUD's specific requirements
2. **Create MythosMUD-specific Instructions**: Add project-specific instructions for MUD development
3. **Integrate with Existing Workflow**: Incorporate Agent OS commands into our development process
4. **Test Commands**: Try the available commands to see how they work with our project

## PowerShell Implementation Notes

The PowerShell scripts provide the same functionality as the original bash scripts but are adapted for Windows environments:

- Uses `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `curl`
- Handles Windows path separators
- Provides colored output for better user experience
- Includes error handling and validation
- Supports all the same parameters as the original scripts

This implementation ensures that Agent OS works seamlessly in our Windows development environment while maintaining full compatibility with the original Agent OS framework.
