## AI Tool Selection

### Primary Tools

1. **GitHub Copilot**: IDE integration for real-time code suggestions
2. **Claude/GPT**: General-purpose AI for complex reasoning and code generation
3. **Cursor AI**: Specialized for code understanding and generation
4. **Code Review Tools**: Automated code analysis and suggestions

### Tool-Specific Strategies

#### GitHub Copilot

```python
# Use descriptive comments to guide Copilot
async def handle_whisper_command(
    command_data: dict, current_user: dict, request: Any, alias_storage: AliasStorage, player_name: str
) -> dict[str, str]:
    """
    Handle the whisper command for private messaging.

    This command allows players to send private messages to other players in the same room.
    Only the target player should see the message.
    """
    # Copilot will suggest the implementation based on the comment
```

#### Claude/GPT

Use detailed prompts with context:

```
I'm implementing a new command called "whisper" for MythosMUD.
The command should allow players to send private messages to other players.

Requirements:
- Syntax: whisper <player> <message>
- Only the target player should see the message
- Players can't whisper to themselves
- Invalid player names should return an error
- Messages should be logged for moderation

Here's the existing command structure:
[Include relevant code examples]

Can you help me implement this command following the project's patterns?
```

---

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### 1. Provide Context

Always include relevant context about the project:

```
I'm working on MythosMUD, a Cthulhu Mythos-themed MUD built with:
- Python/FastAPI backend
- React/TypeScript frontend
- SQLite database
- Pydantic for validation
- Async command handlers

The project follows these patterns:
[Include specific patterns and conventions]
```

### 2. Be Specific About Requirements

```
I need a command handler that:
1. Validates the target player exists
2. Checks if the target is in the same room
3. Sends a private message only to the target
4. Logs the interaction for moderation
5. Returns appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
6. Follows the project's logging and error handling patterns
```

### 3. Include Examples

```
Here are examples of similar commands in the project:

[Include 2-3 relevant command examples]

Please follow the same patterns and conventions.
```

### 4. Specify Output Format

```
Please provide:
1. The command model (Pydantic class)
2. The command handler function
3. Test cases for the handler
4. Any necessary updates to the command parser
5. Brief explanation of the implementation
```

## Command Development Workflow

### Step 1: Planning with AI

**Prompt:**
```
I want to implement a new command called "whisper" for MythosMUD.
Can you help me plan the implementation?

Requirements:
- Players can whisper to other players in the same room
- Only the target player sees the message
- Syntax: whisper <player> <message>
- Should handle edge cases and errors gracefully

What components do I need to implement and what should I consider?
```

**Expected Response:**
- Command model structure
- Handler function requirements
- Integration points
- Security considerations
- Testing scenarios

### Step 2: Model Generation

**Prompt:**
```
Based on the MythosMUD command patterns, create a Pydantic model for a whisper command.

The command should have:
- target_player: required string (player to whisper to)
- message: required string (message content)

Include proper validation and follow the project's patterns.
```

### Step 3: Handler Implementation

**Prompt:**
```
Create a command handler for the whisper command following these patterns:

[Include existing handler examples]

The handler should:
1. Get the persistence layer from request.app.state.persistence
2. Validate the target player exists and is in the same room
3. Send the message only to the target player
4. Log the interaction
5. Handle all error cases gracefully
```

### Step 4: Integration

**Prompt:**
```
I have implemented the whisper command model and handler.
What other files do I need to update to integrate this command?

Please show me the specific changes needed for:
1. Command service registration
2. Command parser updates
3. Command type enum
```

### Step 5: Testing

**Prompt:**
```
Generate comprehensive test cases for the whisper command handler.

Include tests for:
- Successful whisper to valid player
- Whisper to non-existent player
- Whisper to player not in same room
- Whisper to self
- Missing parameters
- Empty message
- Very long message
- Security edge cases
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Iterative Development

```
Don't try to generate everything at once. Use AI for:
1. Initial structure and patterns
2. Review and refinement
3. Testing and edge cases
4. Documentation and cleanup
```

### 2. Context Preservation

```
Always provide sufficient context:
- Project structure and patterns
- Existing code examples
- Specific requirements and constraints
- Error messages and stack traces
```

### 3. Validation and Review

```
Never use AI-generated code without:
1. Understanding what it does
2. Reviewing for security issues
3. Testing thoroughly
4. Ensuring it follows project patterns
```

### 4. Learning and Improvement

```
Use AI to learn:
- Ask for explanations of generated code
- Request alternative approaches
- Get feedback on your implementations
- Understand best practices and patterns
```

### 5. Security First

```
Always review AI-generated code for:
- Input validation
- Authorization checks
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure
- Resource exhaustion
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Reliance on AI

```
❌ Don't: Use AI-generated code without understanding it
✅ Do: Use AI as a tool to accelerate your development, not replace your thinking
```

### 2. Insufficient Context

```
❌ Don't: Ask AI to implement without providing project context
✅ Do: Include relevant code examples, patterns, and requirements
```

### 3. Ignoring Security

```
❌ Don't: Assume AI-generated code is secure
✅ Do: Always review for security issues and validate inputs
```

### 4. Poor Testing

```
❌ Don't: Skip testing AI-generated code
✅ Do: Write comprehensive tests and verify functionality
```

### 5. Inconsistent Patterns

```
❌ Don't: Mix different coding styles and patterns
✅ Do: Ensure AI-generated code follows project conventions
```
