# Chat Panel Separation Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the separation of chat and channel functionality from the current CommandPanel into a dedicated "Chat" panel, while maintaining the command input functionality in the existing "Commands" panel.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Structure
- **CommandPanel**: Currently contains both command input AND chat functionality
  - Channel selector for chat channels
  - Command input field
  - Command history
  - Quick commands (both game commands and channel-specific commands)
  - Chat message routing logic

- **ChatPanel** (to be renamed to "Game Log"): Currently displays all game messages
  - Message display with timestamps
  - Message type styling (chat, system, error, etc.)
  - Clear/download functionality
  - No input capabilities
  - Displays ALL game events (chat, system messages, room updates, etc.)

### Current Integration Points
- Channel selection is handled in CommandPanel
- Chat message routing logic is embedded in CommandPanel
- Both panels receive messages from the same source (GameTerminalWithPanels)

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Enhanced ChatPanel (New Chat Input Panel)

#### New Features to Add
- **Chat Input Section**: Add command input specifically for chat messages
- **Channel Selector**: Move channel selection from CommandPanel to ChatPanel
- **Chat History**: Display recent chat messages with better organization
- **Quick Chat Commands**: Channel-specific quick commands
- **Chat Statistics**: Message counts, channel activity, etc.

#### Enhanced ChatPanel Interface
```typescript
interface EnhancedChatPanelProps {
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  onSendChatMessage: (message: string, channel: string) => void;
  onClearMessages?: () => void;
  onDownloadLogs?: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
  isConnected?: boolean;
  selectedChannel?: string;
  onChannelSelect?: (channelId: string) => void;
}
```

#### ChatPanel Layout Structure
```

```

### 2. Renamed Game Log Panel (Formerly ChatPanel)

#### Purpose and Functionality
- **Game Log Display**: Shows ALL game events and messages
- **Message Types**: Chat messages, system messages, room updates, player events, etc.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Complete game activity history
- **No Input Capabilities**: Read-only display of game events

interface SimplifiedCommandPanelProps {
  commandHistory: string[];
  onSendCommand: (command: string) => void;
  onClearHistory?: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
  isConnected?: boolean;
  placeholder?: string;
}
```

```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Component Refactoring

#### ChatPanel.tsx Enhancements (New Chat Input Panel)
- Add chat input section with channel selector
- Implement chat message sending logic
- Add quick chat commands
- Add chat-specific statistics
- Focus on chat input and channel management

#### GameLogPanel.tsx (Renamed from ChatPanel.tsx)
- Rename component from ChatPanel to GameLogPanel
- Update header to show "Game Log" instead of "Chat Log"
- Enhance message display for all game event types
- Add game log statistics
- Maintain read-only functionality for comprehensive game logging

#### CommandPanel.tsx Simplifications
- Remove channel selector and related logic
- Remove chat message routing
- Simplify command processing to focus on game commands
- Update quick commands to be game-focused only

### 2. Message Routing Logic

#### Current Logic (in CommandPanel)
```typescript
// Current logic determines if command should be routed to chat
const gameCommands = ['look', 'inventory', 'help', ...];
const isGameCommand = gameCommands.includes(firstWord);
if (!command.startsWith('/') && !isGameCommand) {
  finalCommand = `/${channel.shortcut} ${command}`;
}
```

#### New Logic Distribution
- **ChatPanel**: Handle all chat-related commands (say, local, global, whisper, etc.)
- **GameLogPanel**: Display all game events and messages (read-only)
- **CommandPanel**: Handle all game commands (look, inventory, movement, etc.)
- **GameTerminalWithPanels**: Route commands to appropriate panel based on command type

### 3. State Management

#### New State Structure
```typescript
interface ChatState {
  selectedChannel: string;
  chatHistory: ChatMessage[];
  channelActivity: Record<string, number>;
}

interface GameLogState {
  gameMessages: ChatMessage[];
  messageCounts: Record<string, number>;
  totalMessages: number;
}

interface CommandState {
  commandHistory: string[];
  commandSuggestions: string[];
}
```

#### State Distribution
- Chat-related state moves to ChatPanel
- Game log state moves to GameLogPanel
- Command-related state stays in CommandPanel
- Shared state (connection status) remains in GameTerminalWithPanels

### 4. Event Handling

#### Command Routing Logic
```typescript
const handleCommandSubmit = (command: string) => {
  const chatCommands = ['say', 'local', 'global', 'whisper', 'reply'];
  const firstWord = command.split(' ')[0].toLowerCase();

  if (chatCommands.includes(firstWord) || command.startsWith('/')) {
    // Route to ChatPanel
    onSendChatMessage(command, selectedChannel);
  } else {
    // Route to CommandPanel
    onSendGameCommand(command);
  }
};
```

## UI/UX Considerations

### 1. Visual Distinction
- **ChatPanel**: Use chat-themed icons and colors (message bubbles, etc.)
- **GameLogPanel**: Use log-themed icons and colors (document, list, etc.)
- **CommandPanel**: Use command-themed icons and colors (terminal, search, etc.)
- Clear visual separation between chat, game log, and command functionality

### 2. Panel Positioning
- **ChatPanel**: Default position on left side (typical chat placement)
- **GameLogPanel**: Default position on center-left (comprehensive game activity view)
- **CommandPanel**: Default position on right side (typical command placement)
- All panels should be draggable and resizable

### 3. Responsive Design
- Panels should adapt to different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly layouts for smaller screens
- Collapsible sections for space efficiency

### 4. Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management between panels

## Conclusion

This specification provides a comprehensive plan for separating chat functionality into its own dedicated panel while renaming the existing ChatPanel to GameLogPanel to better reflect its purpose of displaying all game events. The approach ensures improved user experience, better code organization, and enhanced maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

The three-panel system (Chat, Game Log, Commands) provides clear separation of concerns:
- **Chat Panel**: Dedicated to chat input and channel management
- **Game Log Panel**: Comprehensive display of all game events and messages
- **Commands Panel**: Focused on game command execution

The phased implementation approach allows for gradual migration and testing, ensuring a smooth transition for users and developers alike.
