# Dual Connection System API Reference

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive API documentation for the dual WebSocket/SSE connection system implemented in MythosMUD. The system allows players to maintain both WebSocket and Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections simultaneously, providing enhanced reliability and performance.

## Connection Endpoints

### WebSocket Connection

**Preferred Endpoint**: `/api/ws`

**Authentication (Recommended)**: WebSocket subprotocols
- Send `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer, <JWT>`

**Query Parameters**:
- `session_id` (optional): Unique session identifier for the game session

**Example**:
```
new WebSocket('/api/ws?session_id=session_123', ['bearer', accessToken])
```

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Legacy path param endpoint `/api/ws/{player_id}` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

**Connection Behavior**:
- Multiple WebSocket connections per player are supported
- Each connection receives all messages sent to the player
- Connections persist until explicitly disconnected or session changes

### SSE Connection

**Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8000/sse/{player_id}`

**Query Parameters**:
- `session_id` (optional): Unique session identifier for the game session

**Example**:
```
http://localhost:8000/sse/test_player?session_id=session_123
```

**Connection Behavior**:
- Multiple SSE connections per player are supported
- Each connection receives all messages sent to the player
- Connections persist until explicitly disconnected or session changes

## Session Management

### New Game Session

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/connections/{player_id}/session`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "session_id": "new_session_456"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "New game session established",
  "session_id": "new_session_456",
  "previous_connections_disconnected": 2,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-06T19:55:00Z"
}
```

**Behavior**:
- Disconnects all existing connections for the player
- Establishes new session tracking
- Player must reconnect with new session ID

### Get Player Session

## Error Handling

### Error Response Format

All API endpoints return errors in the following format:

```json
{
  "error": true,
  "error_type": "connection_error",
  "message": "Failed to establish connection",
  "details": {
    "player_id": "test_player",
    "connection_type": "websocket",
    "error_code": "CONNECTION_FAILED"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-06T19:55:00Z"
}
```

### Common Error Types

- `connection_error`: Connection establishment or maintenance issues
- `session_error`: Session management problems
- `authentication_error`: Authentication or authorization failures
- `validation_error`: Request validation failures
- `system_error`: Internal system errors

### Error Recovery

The system implements automatic error recovery for:
- Temporary connection failures
- Network interruptions
- Server restarts
- Session conflicts

## Client Integration

### React Hook Usage

```typescript
import { useGameConnection } from './hooks/useGameConnection';

function GameComponent() {
  const {
    isConnected,
    isConnecting,
    sessionId,
    connectionHealth,
    connect,
    disconnect,
    sendCommand,
    createNewSession,
    switchToSession,
    getConnectionInfo
  } = useGameConnection({
    playerId: 'test_player',
    onSessionChange: (newSessionId) => {
      console.log('Session changed to:', newSessionId);
    },
    onConnectionHealthUpdate: (health) => {
      console.log('Connection health:', health);
    }
  });

  // Component implementation
}
```

### Connection State Management

The client automatically manages:
- Dual connection establishment
- Session tracking
- Connection health monitoring
- Automatic reconnection
- Message deduplication

## Examples

### Establishing Dual Connections

```javascript
// WebSocket connection
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/test_player?session_id=session_123');

// SSE connection
const eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:8000/sse/test_player?session_id=session_123');

// Both connections will receive messages sent to test_player
```

### Session Management

```javascript
// Create new session
const response = await fetch('/api/connections/test_player/session', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ session_id: 'new_session_456' })
});

// Get current session
const sessionInfo = await fetch('/api/connections/test_player/session');
```

### Monitoring Connection Health

```javascript
// Get connection health statistics
const healthStats = await fetch('/monitoring/connection-health');
const stats = await healthStats.json();

console.log(`Health percentage: ${stats.overall_health.health_percentage}%`);
```

## Best Practices

### Connection Management

1. **Always include session_id** in connection URLs for proper session tracking
2. **Handle connection failures gracefully** with automatic retry logic
3. **Monitor connection health** using the provided monitoring endpoints
4. **Use dual connections** for enhanced reliability in production

### Session Management

1. **Create new sessions** when starting new game instances
2. **Switch sessions** when changing game contexts
3. **Clean up old sessions** to prevent resource leaks
4. **Validate session state** before critical operations

### Error Handling

1. **Implement retry logic** for temporary failures
2. **Log errors appropriately** for debugging
3. **Provide user feedback** for connection issues
4. **Monitor error rates** using the monitoring endpoints

### Performance Optimization

1. **Limit concurrent connections** per player (recommended: 2-4)
2. **Monitor performance metrics** regularly
3. **Implement connection pooling** for high-traffic scenarios
4. **Use health checks** to identify and resolve issues quickly

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- All connections require valid player authentication
- Session IDs should be cryptographically secure
- Implement rate limiting for connection attempts

### Authorization

- Players can only access their own connections
- Session validation prevents unauthorized access
- Connection metadata is protected from external access

### Data Protection

- Connection logs exclude sensitive information
- Session data is encrypted in transit
- Implement proper cleanup of connection metadata

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failures**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify server status
   - Validate session ID format

2. **Message Delivery Issues**
   - Check connection health status
   - Verify player authentication
   - Review server logs for errors

3. **Session Management Problems**
   - Ensure session ID uniqueness
   - Check session validation logic
   - Verify connection cleanup

### Debugging Tools

- Use monitoring endpoints for system health
- Check connection statistics for patterns
- Review performance metrics for bottlenecks
- Monitor error logs for recurring issues
