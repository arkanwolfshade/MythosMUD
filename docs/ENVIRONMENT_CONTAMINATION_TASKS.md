# Spec Tasks

## Environment Contamination Remediation Tasks

Based on the Environment Contamination Audit Report, the following tasks are required to eliminate environment-specific conditional logic from production code and ensure compliance with our environment-agnostic architecture principle.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. **CRITICAL: Remove Environment Detection from Logging System**
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for logging environment detection removal
  - [ ] 1.2 Remove pytest detection logic from `detect_environment()` function
  - [ ] 1.3 Remove `MYTHOSMUD_TEST_MODE` environment variable detection
  - [ ] 1.4 Update `detect_environment()` to use only `MYTHOSMUD_ENV` variable
  - [ ] 1.5 Update function documentation to reflect new behavior
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify all logging tests pass with new environment detection
  - [ ] 1.7 Test logging system in different environment configurations
  - [ ] 1.8 Verify no environment-specific behavior remains

- [ ] 2. **Update Test Configuration for Explicit Environment Control**
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for test environment configuration
  - [ ] 2.2 Update test configuration files to explicitly set `MYTHOSMUD_ENV=test`
  - [ ] 2.3 Remove any test-specific environment detection logic
  - [ ] 2.4 Update test fixtures to use explicit environment configuration
  - [ ] 2.5 Verify all tests pass with explicit environment configuration
  - [ ] 2.6 Update test documentation to reflect new configuration approach
  - [ ] 2.7 Test test suite runs correctly in different environments
  - [ ] 2.8 Verify no automatic environment detection in test code

- [ ] 3. **Create Centralized Environment Management Service**
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for centralized environment service
  - [ ] 3.2 Create `server/environment.py` module for environment management
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement `get_environment()` function with proper validation
  - [ ] 3.4 Add environment validation and error handling
  - [ ] 3.5 Update all modules to use centralized environment service
  - [ ] 3.6 Remove direct environment variable access from business logic
  - [ ] 3.7 Verify all modules use centralized environment service
  - [ ] 3.8 Test environment service in all supported environments

- [ ] 4. **Implement Environment Contamination Prevention Measures**
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for contamination detection
  - [ ] 4.2 Create linting rules to detect environment-specific logic
  - [ ] 4.3 Add pre-commit hooks for environment contamination checks
  - [ ] 4.4 Update code review guidelines for environment contamination
  - [ ] 4.5 Create automated tests to verify environment-agnostic behavior
  - [ ] 4.6 Document acceptable vs. unacceptable environment patterns
  - [ ] 4.7 Train development team on new guidelines
  - [ ] 4.8 Verify prevention measures catch potential violations

- [ ] 5. **Security and Compliance Verification**
  - [ ] 5.1 Write security tests for environment detection removal
  - [ ] 5.2 Verify no security vulnerabilities from environment detection
  - [ ] 5.3 Test that production behavior is consistent across environments
  - [ ] 5.4 Verify logging system security posture is maintained
  - [ ] 5.5 Test environment variable injection attacks are prevented
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify compliance with environment-agnostic architecture
  - [ ] 5.7 Document security implications of changes
  - [ ] 5.8 Final verification that all production code is environment-agnostic

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Priority

Task 1 is **CRITICAL** and must be completed immediately as it represents a fundamental architectural violation.

### Dependencies

- Task 2 depends on Task 1 completion
- Task 3 can be developed in parallel with Task 2
- Task 4 should be implemented after Tasks 1-3 are complete
- Task 5 is the final verification step

### Testing Strategy

Each task follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:

1. Write tests first to define expected behavior
2. Implement changes to make tests pass
3. Verify all existing tests continue to pass
4. Add integration tests for environment scenarios

### Success Criteria

- All production code is environment-agnostic
- No conditional logic based on execution context
- Explicit environment configuration only
- Comprehensive test coverage for environment scenarios
- Automated prevention of future contamination
