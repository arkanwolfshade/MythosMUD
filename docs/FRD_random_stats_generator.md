# Feature Requirements Document: Random Stats Generator

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a random stats generator feature for character creation in MythosMUD. The feature allows new users to roll random character statistics during the character creation process, with the ability to reroll until they are satisfied with their character's attributes.

## User Story
As a new player, I want to randomly generate my character's starting stats during character creation so that I can create a unique character quickly and easily without spending excessive time manually assigning points.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] The character creator presents a "Roll for Stats" option in addition to any existing stat allocation methods
- [x] The "Roll for Stats" option generates a set of random values for each core character statistic within defined minimum and maximum ranges
- [x] The generated stats are clearly displayed to the player, along with the option to accept or re-roll the stats
- [x] A new set of random stats is generated if the player chooses to re-roll
- [x] The system ensures that the generated stats allow the player to select a valid starting class (if classes have stat prerequisites)
- [x] The stats are permanently assigned to the character once the player accepts the generated stats and cannot be re-rolled again during that character creation session

## User Flow

### 1. Registration Process
1. User enters registration code
2. User completes registration form (username becomes character name)
3. **NEW**: User proceeds to stats rolling screen

### 2. Stats Rolling Process
1. System displays stats rolling interface with character name (from registration)
2. System automatically rolls initial stats using 3d6 method
3. User views rolled stats (raw numbers only)
4. User can either:
   - Accept the stats (proceeds to game)
   - Reroll all stats (with 1-second cooldown)
5. Upon acceptance, character is saved to database and user is automatically logged in

### 3. Error Handling
- If API is unavailable during stats rolling: Show error message and redirect to registration
- If session expires: Redirect to login
- If database save fails: Show error and allow retry

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements
1. **Stats Rolling Screen**
   - Display character name from registration (read-only)
   - Display all six core stats with raw numbers
   - "Reroll Stats" button (disabled during 1-second cooldown)
   - "Accept Stats" button
   - Loading states for API calls

2. **Stats Display Format**
   - Strength: [number]
   - Dexterity: [number]
   - Constitution: [number]
   - Intelligence: [number]
   - Wisdom: [number]
   - Charisma: [number]

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - 1-second cooldown between reroll attempts
   - Visual feedback during cooldown (disabled button, countdown)

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network error messages
   - API error messages
   - Redirect logic for critical failures

### Backend Requirements
1. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /players/roll-stats` - Roll new stats
   - `POST /players/validate-stats` - Validate stats format
   - `GET /players/available-classes` - Get class information

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Server-side rate limiting for reroll endpoint
   - 1-second minimum interval between requests

3. **Validation**
   - Server-side validation of all stats
   - Ensure stats are within valid ranges (3-18)
   - Validate character name uniqueness

4. **Persistence**
   - Save character only after stats acceptance
   - No intermediate saves during rolling process

### Security Requirements
1. **Authentication**
   - Require valid session for stats rolling
   - Validate user permissions for character creation

2. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation of all inputs
   - No client-side validation (rely on server only)

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent abuse of reroll endpoint
   - Log suspicious activity

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
1. **Stats Display**
   - Clean, readable format
   - Consistent with existing UI
   - Clear visual hierarchy

2. **Buttons**
   - "Reroll Stats" - Primary action button
   - "Accept Stats" - Success action button
   - Disabled states during cooldown

3. **Loading States**
   - Spinner during API calls
   - Disabled interactions during loading

### User Experience
1. **Immediate Feedback**
   - Instant response to button clicks
   - Clear error messages
   - Loading indicators

2. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - High contrast mode support

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Touch-friendly button sizes
   - Responsive layout
   - Mobile-optimized interactions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Stats Rolling
- [x] Create stats rolling screen component
- [x] Implement stats display
- [x] Add reroll functionality
- [x] Implement rate limiting

### Phase 2: Integration
- [x] Integrate with registration flow
- [x] Add character name display (from registration)
- [x] Implement acceptance flow
- [x] Add automatic login

### Phase 3: Error Handling & Polish
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement loading states
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for components
- [ ] Integration tests for API
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Performance testing

## Success Metrics
1. **User Engagement**
   - Average number of rerolls per character creation
   - Time spent on stats rolling screen
   - Completion rate of character creation

2. **Technical Performance**
   - API response times
   - Error rates
   - Rate limiting effectiveness

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - User feedback on stats rolling experience
   - Reduction in character creation abandonment
   - Positive feedback on feature usability

## Dependencies
1. **Backend API** - Stats generator service (âœ… Complete)
2. **Authentication System** - User session management
3. **Database Schema** - Character storage
4. **UI Components** - Button, loading, error components

## Risks & Mitigation
1. **API Performance** - Implement caching and rate limiting
2. **User Experience** - Extensive testing and user feedback
3. **Security** - Server-side validation and rate limiting
4. **Mobile Experience** - Responsive design and touch optimization

## Future Enhancements
1. **Visual Stats Display** - Charts, bars, or visual representations
2. **Individual Stat Rerolling** - Reroll specific stats only
3. **Multiple Rolling Methods** - Allow users to choose different methods
4. **Class Prerequisites** - Show which classes the stats qualify for
5. **Stat History** - Show previous rolls for comparison
