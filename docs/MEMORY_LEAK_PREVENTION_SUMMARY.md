# Memory Leak Prevention System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ **Objective Achieved**

Successfully implemented a comprehensive memory leak prevention system for MythosMUD, addressing the critical issue identified in the PLANNING_main_refactor.md document. This system provides proactive memory monitoring, automatic cleanup, and comprehensive alerting to prevent memory leaks in the real-time communication infrastructure.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

### **Core Components**

1. **MemoryMonitor Class** (`server/realtime/connection_manager.py`)
   - Real-time memory usage tracking using `psutil`
   - Configurable cleanup triggers (time-based and memory-based)
   - Memory threshold monitoring (80% default)
   - Comprehensive memory statistics collection

2. **Enhanced ConnectionManager**
   - Memory monitoring integration
   - Automatic cleanup triggers
   - Connection timestamp tracking
   - Stale connection detection and cleanup
   - Data structure size limiting

3. **Monitoring API Endpoints** (`server/api/monitoring.py`)
   - `/monitoring/memory` - Comprehensive memory statistics
   - `/monitoring/memory-alerts` - Memory-related alerts and warnings
   - `/monitoring/memory/cleanup` - Force immediate cleanup (admin)

## üîß **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Memory Usage Monitoring**
- **Real-time tracking**: Continuous monitoring of process memory usage
- **Threshold-based alerts**: Warnings at 70%, 80%, and 90% memory usage
- **Memory statistics**: RSS, VMS, percentage, available/total memory
- **Process-level monitoring**: Using `psutil` for accurate system metrics

### **2. Automatic Cleanup System**
- **Time-based cleanup**: Every 5 minutes (configurable)
- **Memory-based cleanup**: Triggered when memory usage exceeds 80%
- **Orphaned data cleanup**: Removes old connection attempts and pending messages
- **Stale connection cleanup**: Closes connections older than 1 hour
- **Data structure limiting**: Prevents unlimited growth of rate limit and message queues

### **3. Connection Management Enhancements**
- **Connection timestamps**: Track when each connection was established
- **Stale connection detection**: Identify and close old connections
- **Proper resource disposal**: Ensure WebSocket connections are properly closed
- **Memory leak prevention**: Clean up all references when connections are closed

### **4. Data Structure Management**
- **Rate limiting cleanup**: Remove old connection attempts (1 hour TTL)
- **Pending message cleanup**: Remove old pending messages (1 hour TTL)
- **Size limiting**: Maximum 1000 entries per player for rate limits and messages
- **Automatic pruning**: Remove empty data structures

### **5. Comprehensive Alerting**
- **Memory usage alerts**: Critical, warning, and info levels
- **Large data structure alerts**: Warn when structures exceed 1000 entries
- **Stale connection alerts**: Detect and warn about old connections
- **Real-time monitoring**: Continuous alert generation

    max_pending_messages = 1000  # Max per player
    max_rate_limit_entries = 1000  # Max per player
```

### **Cleanup Thresholds**
- **Time-based cleanup**: Every 5 minutes
- **Memory-based cleanup**: When usage exceeds 80%
