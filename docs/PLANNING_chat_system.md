### üéØ **Next Priority**: Server-Side Message Filtering

Implement room-based filtering to reduce network traffic and improve performance.

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive chat system for MythosMUD, addressing both the core chat channels (Issue #18) and the full chat system with moderation features (Issue #58). The system will enable players to communicate across multiple channels while maintaining the eldritch atmosphere of our Miskatonic University setting.

## Implementation Strategy: Tracer Bullet Approach

### Tracer Bullet Philosophy

The implementation follows a **tracer bullet** approach, using the `say` channel as the initial target to validate the entire system architecture quickly. This allows us to:

- **Validate architecture**: Test all subsystems with minimal implementation
- **Rapid feedback**: Get working chat functionality in 1-2 weeks
- **Iterative development**: Build on validated foundation
- **Risk mitigation**: Identify issues early in the development cycle

### MVP Definition

**Minimum Viable Product**: A working `say` channel that allows players in the same room to communicate in real-time.

**Success Criteria**:

- Players can use `/say <message>` command
- Messages appear instantly for all players in the same room
- Basic chat interface displays messages
- System architecture supports future expansion

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Chat Channels (Issue #18)

- **Global Channel**: System-wide communication accessible to all players
- **Local Channel**: Area-wide communication (current room + adjacent areas)
- **Party Channel**: Group communication for players in the same party
- **Say Channel**: Direct speech within the current room only
- **Whisper Channel**: Private communication between specific players

### Advanced Features (Issue #58)

- **Communication Controls**: Mute, filters, and channel preferences
- **Moderation System**: Profanity filtering, harm-related keyword detection
- **Admin Tools**: Moderator commands and administrative oversight
- **Chat Logging**: Audit trail and message history
- **Real-time Delivery**: WebSocket-based instant messaging
- **User Interface**: Intuitive chat interface components

## User Experience & Commands

### Chat Commands

```
/global <message>      - System-wide communication
/local <message>       - Area-wide communication (current room + adjacent)
/say <message>         - Room-only speech
/party <message>       - Group communication
/whisper <player> <msg> - Private messaging
/tell <player> <msg>   - Alternative private messaging
```

### Channel Management Commands

```
/mute <channel>        - Mute specific channel (global, local, party)
/unmute <channel>      - Unmute specific channel
/mute <player>         - Mute specific player across all channels
/unmute <player>       - Unmute specific player
/mute all              - Mute all channels except whispers
/unmute all            - Unmute all channels
/channels              - Show current channel status
/channels muted        - Show muted channels
/channels active       - Show active channels
/muted players         - Show list of muted players
```

### Channel Subscription Model

- **Automatic Subscription**: Players are automatically subscribed based on context
- **Say/Local**: Automatically active when in rooms
- **Global**: Always available (but can be muted)
- **Party**: Automatically joined when in a party
- **Whisper**: Always available for private communication
- **No Manual Join/Leave**: Use mute/unmute instead for better UX

### Player Muting Rules

- **Player Muting**: Users can mute specific players across all channels
- **Admin Protection**: Admins and moderators cannot be muted by regular users
- **Self-Muting**: Players cannot mute themselves
- **Cross-Channel**: Muted players are hidden from all channels (global, local, party, say)
- **Whisper Exception**: Muted players can still send whispers (for emergency communication)
- **Admin Override**: Admins can mute/unmute any player, including other admins

### Rate Limiting Strategy

- **Per-User Limits**: Rate limiting is applied per user, not globally
- **Sliding Window**: Uses sliding window algorithm for accurate rate tracking
- **Channel-Specific**: Different limits for different channels based on usage patterns
- **Admin Bypass**: Admins and moderators are exempt from rate limiting

#### Rate Limits (Per User Per Minute)

```
Global Channel: 10 messages per minute per user
Local Channel: 20 messages per minute per user
Party Channel: 30 messages per minute per user
Say Channel: 15 messages per minute per user
Whisper Channel: 5 messages per minute per user
```

#### Rate Limiting Implementation

- **Storage**: In-memory cache with Redis for distributed deployments
- **Algorithm**: Sliding window with 1-minute buckets
- **Response**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **Monitoring**: Rate limit violations logged for moderation review

### Message Display Format

```
[Global] Prof. Armitage: Welcome to Miskatonic University
[Local] Dr. Wilmarth: Is anyone in the library complex?
Prof. Armitage says, "The restricted section is this way."
[Party] Prof. Armitage: Let's investigate the basement together
Prof. Armitage whispers to you, "I found something disturbing..."
```

### Muting Examples

```
/mute global              - Mute global channel
/mute Ithaqua             - Mute player "Ithaqua" across all channels
/unmute local             - Unmute local channel
/unmute Yog-Sothoth       - Unmute player "Yog-Sothoth"
/muted players            - Show: "Muted players: Ithaqua, Cthulhu"
/channels muted           - Show: "Muted channels: global"
```

### Muting Behavior

- **Channel Muting**: Messages from muted channels are completely hidden
- **Player Muting**: Messages from muted players are hidden in all channels except whispers
- **Admin Messages**: Cannot be muted by regular users (system protection)
- **Whisper Exception**: Muted players can still send whispers for emergency communication
- **Cross-Session**: Mute settings persist across game sessions

## Technical Architecture

### Redis Pub/Sub System

#### Redis Channels Structure

```
chat:global          - Global channel messages
chat:local:{room_id} - Local channel messages per room
chat:party:{party_id} - Party channel messages
chat:say:{room_id}   - Say channel messages per room
chat:whisper:{player_id} - Whisper messages per player
chat:system          - System announcements
```

#### Redis Data Structures

```redis
# Session message history (TTL: 24 hours)
HSET chat:session:{player_id}:{channel} {message_id} {message_json}

# Rate limiting (TTL: 1 minute)
INCR chat:rate:{player_id}:{channel}
EXPIRE chat:rate:{player_id}:{channel} 60

# Mute settings (persistent)
HSET chat:mutes:{player_id} {target_type}:{target_id} {mute_data_json}

# Online players per channel
SADD chat:online:{channel} {player_id}
SREM chat:online:{channel} {player_id}
```

#### Performance Benefits

- **Message Delivery**: < 1ms latency
- **Concurrent Users**: 100+ supported (optimized for 10-100 range)
- **Message Volume**: 1000+ messages per minute capacity
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient session storage
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Redis Cluster
- **Reliability**: Message persistence and delivery guarantees

### Backend Components

```python
class ChatMessage(BaseModel):
    """Represents a chat message in the system"""
    id: str
    sender_id: str
    channel: str
    content: str
    timestamp: datetime
    filtered: bool = False
    moderation_notes: Optional[str] = None

class ChatChannel(BaseModel):

    name: str
    type: str  # global, local, party, say, whisper
    participants: set[str]
    moderators: set[str]
    settings: dict

class RateLimitInfo(BaseModel):
    """Rate limiting information for a user-channel combination"""
    player_id: str
    channel: str
    message_count: int
    window_start: datetime
    last_message_time: datetime
```

#### 3. Chat API Endpoints (`server/api/chat.py`)

```python
@router.post("/chat/send")
async def send_message(request: SendMessageRequest)

@router.post("/chat/join")
async def join_channel(request: JoinChannelRequest)

@router.post("/chat/leave")
async def leave_channel(request: LeaveChannelRequest)

@router.get("/chat/muted/channels")
async def get_muted_channels(player_id: str)

@router.get("/chat/muted/players")
async def get_muted_players(player_id: str)
```

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Chat Interface (`client/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`)

- **Desktop-optimized**: Designed for desktop web browsers
- **Channel tabs**: Switching between chat types
- **Message input**: Full keyboard support with send button
- **Message history**: Scrollable message display
- **User list**: Current channel participants
- **Mute/unmute controls**: Channel and player management
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Hotkeys for common actions

#### 2. Chat Hook (`client/src/hooks/useChat.ts`)

```typescript
interface UseChatReturn {
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  sendMessage: (channel: string, content: string) => Promise<void>;
  joinChannel: (channel: string) => Promise<void>;
  leaveChannel: (channel: string) => Promise<void>;
  isConnected: boolean;
}
```

## Chat Logging & Storage

### Chat Log Files

- **Location**: `logs/chat/` directory
- **Format**: JSON-structured logs for AI integration
- **Rotation**: Daily log files with timestamp naming
- **Retention**: 30 days by default, configurable

### Redis Pub/Sub Architecture

- **Message Broker**: Redis for real-time message distribution
- **Session History**: In-memory session storage with Redis
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond message delivery
- **Scalability**: Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- **Reliability**: Message persistence and delivery guarantees

### Log File Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T10:30:00Z",
  "channel": "global",
  "sender_id": "player_123",
  "sender_name": "Prof. Armitage",
  "content": "Welcome to Miskatonic University",
  "room_id": "arkham_campus_001",
  "filtered": false,
  "moderation_notes": null
}
```

### Database Schema (Minimal - Only for Mute Settings)

```sql
-- Chat mute settings (persistent across sessions)
CREATE TABLE chat_mute_settings (
    player_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    target_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'channel' or 'player'
    target_id TEXT NOT NULL,   -- channel name or player id
    muted_until DATETIME,
    muted_by TEXT, -- moderator who applied mute
    reason TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (player_id, target_type, target_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (muted_by) REFERENCES players(id)
);
```

-- Chat moderation logs (for admin oversight)
CREATE TABLE chat_moderation_logs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    moderator_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    target_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    action TEXT NOT NULL, -- mute, unmute, ban, etc.
    reason TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (moderator_id) REFERENCES players(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (target_id) REFERENCES players(id)
);

```

## Prerequisites: System Infrastructure Requirements

### Critical Infrastructure Fixes (Required Before Chat Implementation)

#### 1. Multiplayer Configuration Fix
**Issue**: `allow_multiplay: false` in production config blocks multiplayer functionality
**Fix Required**:
```yaml
# server/server_config.yaml
allow_multiplay: true  # Enable multiplayer for chat functionality
```

**Impact**: Without this fix, only one player can connect at a time, making chat impossible.

#### 2. Room Adjacency Logic Implementation

**Issue**: `get_adjacent_rooms()` returns empty list, needed for local channel
**Fix Required**: Complete implementation in `server/game/room_service.py`

```python
def get_adjacent_rooms(self, room_id: str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get rooms adjacent to the specified room for local chat scope."""
    # Implementation needed for local channel functionality
```

**Impact**: Local channel cannot function without room adjacency logic.

#### 3. Player Name Resolution System

**Issue**: Inconsistent player lookup between ID and name
**Fix Required**: Robust player name resolution for whisper commands

```python
def resolve_player_name(self, identifier: str) -> Player | None:
    """Resolve player by ID or name with consistent behavior."""
    # Implementation needed for whisper functionality
```

**Impact**: Whisper commands cannot function without reliable player name resolution.
