## Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```
1. User Registration
   â”œâ”€â”€ Validate invite code
   â”œâ”€â”€ Create user account
   â”œâ”€â”€ Generate JWT token
   â””â”€â”€ Return token to client

2. User Login
   â”œâ”€â”€ Validate credentials
   â”œâ”€â”€ Generate JWT token
   â””â”€â”€ Return token to client

3. Authenticated Requests
   â”œâ”€â”€ Include JWT in Authorization header
   â”œâ”€â”€ Validate token on server
   â””â”€â”€ Process authenticated request
```

### Real-time Communication Flow

```
1. Client Connection
   â”œâ”€â”€ Establish WebSocket/SSE connection
   â”œâ”€â”€ Authenticate with JWT token
   â””â”€â”€ Join player session

2. Game Events
   â”œâ”€â”€ Player actions trigger events
   â”œâ”€â”€ Events published to event bus
   â”œâ”€â”€ Relevant clients notified
   â””â”€â”€ Client state updated

3. Disconnection
   â”œâ”€â”€ Clean up player session
   â”œâ”€â”€ Notify other players
   â””â”€â”€ Save player state
```

## Implementation Details

### JWT Authentication Fix (COMPLETED)

**Issue**: JWT tokens were not being properly validated in the stats rolling endpoint.

**Root Cause**: The stats rolling endpoint was using `get_current_user_with_logging()` which was catching authentication exceptions and returning `None` instead of re-raising them.

**Solution**:
1. Updated the stats rolling endpoint to use the standard `get_current_user` dependency
2. Removed the problematic `get_current_user_with_logging()` wrapper
3. Added comprehensive tests to verify the complete authentication flow

**Files Modified**:
- `server/api/players.py`: Updated authentication dependency
- `server/tests/test_jwt_authentication_flow.py`: Added comprehensive authentication tests

**Test Results**: All authentication tests now pass, including:
- Complete authentication flow (registration â†’ JWT â†’ stats rolling)
- Authentication failure cases (no token, invalid token)
- Login flow verification

### Real-time Event System

The event system uses a publish-subscribe pattern:

```python
# Event publishing
event_bus.publish(PlayerMovedEvent(player_id, new_room))

# Event subscription
@event_handler.subscribe(PlayerMovedEvent)
async def handle_player_moved(event: PlayerMovedEvent):
    # Notify relevant clients
    await notify_clients(event)
```

### Connection Management

The connection manager handles:
- WebSocket connections
- SSE connections
- Player session management
- Connection cleanup

## Testing Strategy

### Authentication Tests
- âœ… Registration flow
- âœ… Login flow
- âœ… JWT token validation
- âœ… Protected endpoint access
- âœ… Authentication failure cases

### Real-time Tests
- ðŸ”„ WebSocket connection handling
- ðŸ”„ Event publishing and subscription
- ðŸ”„ Client notification
- ðŸ”„ Connection cleanup

### Integration Tests
- ðŸ”„ End-to-end multiplayer scenarios
- ðŸ”„ Performance under load
- ðŸ”„ Error handling and recovery

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Event Batching**: Batch multiple events for efficient processing
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data (rooms, player stats)

### Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of authentication endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Token Expiration**: Automatic JWT token expiration
- **Secure Headers**: Proper security headers for web endpoints

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. **Complete Real-time Movement**: Finish player movement synchronization
2. **Chat System**: Implement basic chat functionality
3. **Player Visibility**: Show other players in the same room

### Short Term (Next Month)
1. **Combat System**: Real-time combat mechanics
2. **Player Groups**: Party formation and management
3. **Enhanced Events**: More sophisticated event types

### Long Term (Next Quarter)
1. **Cross-server Communication**: Multi-server player interaction
2. **Advanced Social Features**: Guilds, trading, etc.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Load testing and optimization

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Authentication Success Rate**: >99.9%
- **Real-time Latency**: <100ms for most operations
- **Connection Stability**: <1% connection drops
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for multiplayer features

### User Experience Metrics
- **Player Retention**: Measure player engagement
- **Concurrent Players**: Track peak concurrent users
- **Feature Usage**: Monitor usage of multiplayer features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Scalability Issues**: Monitor performance and implement caching
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and updates
- **Data Consistency**: Implement proper transaction handling

### User Experience Risks
- **Network Issues**: Implement reconnection logic
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor and optimize critical paths
- **Feature Complexity**: Maintain intuitive user interface

## Conclusion

The JWT authentication system is now fully functional and tested. The real-time communication infrastructure is in place, and the foundation for advanced multiplayer features is solid. The next phase should focus on completing the real-time movement system and implementing basic chat functionality to provide immediate value to players.
