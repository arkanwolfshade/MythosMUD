## Technical Architecture

### ✅ Frontend Architecture - IMPLEMENTED
```
StatsRollingScreen
├── StatsDisplay (shows raw numbers)
├── RerollButton (with cooldown)
├── AcceptButton
├── LoadingSpinner
└── ErrorMessage
```

### ✅ Backend Architecture - IMPLEMENTED
```
API Endpoints
├── POST /players/roll-stats (rate limited)
├── POST /players/create-character (with stats)
└── GET /players/available-classes
```

### ✅ Data Flow - IMPLEMENTED
1. User enters character name
2. System rolls initial stats
3. User views stats and can reroll
4. User accepts stats
5. Character is created and user is logged in

## Key Implementation Decisions

### ✅ 1. Rate Limiting Strategy - IMPLEMENTED
- **✅ Client-side**: 1-second cooldown with visual feedback
- **✅ Server-side**: Rate limiting on reroll endpoint
- **✅ Implementation**: Use React hooks for client-side, middleware for server-side

### ✅ 2. State Management - IMPLEMENTED
- **✅ Approach**: Stateless, server-side
- **✅ Rationale**: Simpler implementation, better security
- **✅ Implementation**: Each roll is independent API call

### ✅ 3. Error Handling Strategy - IMPLEMENTED
- **✅ Network errors**: Show error message, allow retry
- **✅ API errors**: Show specific error message
- **✅ Critical failures**: Redirect to registration
- **✅ Implementation**: React error boundaries + try/catch

### ✅ 4. UI/UX Decisions - IMPLEMENTED
- **✅ Stats display**: Raw numbers only (simple, clean)
- **✅ Button layout**: Reroll (primary) + Accept (success)
- **✅ Loading states**: Spinner + disabled buttons
- **✅ Mobile**: Responsive design with touch-friendly buttons

## Risk Mitigation

### ✅ Technical Risks - RESOLVED
1. **✅ API Performance**
   - **✅ Mitigation**: Rate limiting, caching, monitoring
   - **✅ Fallback**: Graceful degradation

2. **✅ Rate Limiting Abuse**
   - **✅ Mitigation**: Server-side rate limiting, logging
   - **✅ Fallback**: IP-based blocking

3. **✅ Mobile Experience**
   - **✅ Mitigation**: Responsive design, touch optimization
   - **✅ Fallback**: Desktop-first with mobile compatibility

### ✅ User Experience Risks - RESOLVED
1. **✅ Confusing Interface**
   - **✅ Mitigation**: Clear labels, simple layout
   - **✅ Fallback**: User testing and feedback

2. **✅ Slow Performance**
   - **✅ Mitigation**: Optimized API calls, loading states
   - **✅ Fallback**: Progressive enhancement
