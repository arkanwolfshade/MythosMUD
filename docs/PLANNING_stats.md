# PLANNING: Random Stats Generator Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the random stats generator feature in MythosMUD. The feature will be integrated into the character creation flow, allowing users to roll random stats and reroll until they are satisfied.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Stats Rolling (Week 1)
**Goal**: Create the basic stats rolling functionality

#### Backend Tasks
- [x] ✅ StatsGenerator service (COMPLETE)
- [x] ✅ API endpoints for rolling stats (COMPLETE)
- [x] ✅ Class validation system (COMPLETE)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to reroll endpoint
- [ ] Add character creation endpoint that accepts stats
- [ ] Update player creation flow to include stats

#### Frontend Tasks
- [ ] Create StatsRollingScreen component
- [ ] Implement stats display (raw numbers only)
- [ ] Add reroll button with 1-second cooldown
- [ ] Add accept stats button
- [ ] Implement loading states

#### Integration Tasks
- [ ] Update registration flow to include stats rolling
- [ ] Add character name display in stats screen
- [ ] Implement automatic login after stats acceptance

### Phase 2: Error Handling & Polish (Week 2)
**Goal**: Robust error handling and user experience improvements

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for API failures
- [ ] Implement redirect logic for critical failures
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Handle session expiration gracefully

#### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Implement mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add visual feedback for rate limiting
- [ ] Polish loading states and transitions

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for StatsRollingScreen component
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests for character creation flow
- [ ] Performance testing for rate limiting

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Week 3)
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and validation

#### Testing Tasks
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Security testing for rate limiting

#### Validation Tasks
- [ ] Validate user flow matches requirements
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Verify rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Check accessibility compliance

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
```
StatsRollingScreen
├── StatsDisplay (shows raw numbers)
├── RerollButton (with cooldown)
├── AcceptButton
├── LoadingSpinner
└── ErrorMessage
```

### Backend Architecture
```
API Endpoints
├── POST /players/roll-stats (rate limited)
├── POST /players/create-character (with stats)
└── GET /players/available-classes
```

### Data Flow
1. User enters character name
2. System rolls initial stats
3. User views stats and can reroll
4. User accepts stats
5. Character is created and user is logged in

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Rate Limiting Strategy
- **Client-side**: 1-second cooldown with visual feedback
- **Server-side**: Rate limiting on reroll endpoint
- **Implementation**: Use React hooks for client-side, middleware for server-side

### 2. State Management
- **Approach**: Stateless, server-side
- **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, better security
- **Implementation**: Each roll is independent API call

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
- **Network errors**: Show error message, allow retry
- **API errors**: Show specific error message
- **Critical failures**: Redirect to registration
- **Implementation**: React error boundaries + try/catch

### 4. UI/UX Decisions
- **Stats display**: Raw numbers only (simple, clean)
- **Button layout**: Reroll (primary) + Accept (success)
- **Loading states**: Spinner + disabled buttons
- **Mobile**: Responsive design with touch-friendly buttons

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API Performance**
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, caching, monitoring
   - Fallback: Graceful degradation

2. **Rate Limiting Abuse**
   - Mitigation: Server-side rate limiting, logging
   - Fallback: IP-based blocking

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Mitigation: Responsive design, touch optimization
   - Fallback: Desktop-first with mobile compatibility

### User Experience Risks
1. **Confusing Interface**
   - Mitigation: Clear labels, simple layout
   - Fallback: User testing and feedback

2. **Slow Performance**
   - Mitigation: Optimized API calls, loading states
   - Fallback: Progressive enhancement

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can roll random stats during character creation
- [ ] Users can reroll stats with 1-second cooldown
- [ ] Users can accept stats and proceed to game
- [ ] Character is saved to database upon acceptance
- [ ] Error handling works for all failure scenarios

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] API response time < 500ms for stats rolling
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Mobile performance is acceptable
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance degradation

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Interface is intuitive and easy to use
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Loading states provide good feedback
- [ ] Mobile experience is smooth

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- [x] ✅ Backend API (COMPLETE)
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Database schema
- [ ] UI component library

### Internal Dependencies
- [ ] Registration flow updates
- [ ] Character creation flow updates
- [ ] Error handling system
- [ ] Rate limiting system
