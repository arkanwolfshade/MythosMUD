# MythosMUD Client Migration Plan: MUI → TailwindCSS

*"That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die."*

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive migration strategy for converting the MythosMUD client from Material-UI (MUI) to TailwindCSS while preserving the sacred MOTD styling and enhancing the overall Mythos experience.

## Sacred Preservation: MOTD Styling

**MOTD Must Remain Unchanged:**

- All `.motd-*` CSS classes preserved exactly as they are
- The Yellow Sign animation and shimmer effects maintained
- Golden color scheme (`#d4af37`, `#ffd700`) preserved
- Courier New font family maintained
- All text shadows and glow effects preserved
- The sacred gradient backgrounds and animations untouched

**MOTD Protection Strategy:**

- Extract MOTD styles to separate CSS file
- Ensure TailwindCSS doesn't interfere with MOTD classes
- Maintain the `!important` declarations for MOTD styling
- Preserve the shimmer animation keyframes

## Current State Analysis

**MUI Dependencies Currently Used:**

- `@mui/material` (v7.3.1) - Core components
- `@mui/icons-material` (v7.3.1) - Icons
- `@emotion/react` & `@emotion/styled` - Styling system
- Custom theme with extensive MythosMUD styling

**Key Components Using MUI:**

- `App.tsx` - ThemeProvider, CssBaseline
- `DraggablePanel.tsx` - Paper, Box, IconButton, Tooltip, Typography
- `ChatPanel.tsx` - Box, IconButton, Tooltip, Typography, styled components
- All panel components (CommandPanel, PlayerPanel, etc.)
- `StatsRollingScreen.tsx` - Extensive MUI usage
- `CommandHelpDrawer.tsx` - Drawer, List components

## Migration Strategy

### ✅ Phase 1: Setup & MOTD Protection (COMPLETED)

#### ✅ 1.1 Install TailwindCSS with MOTD Safeguards

```bash
# Remove MUI dependencies
npm uninstall @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

# Install TailwindCSS and icon replacement
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npm install lucide-react
```

#### ✅ 1.2 Configure TailwindCSS with MOTD Exclusion

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  // Exclude MOTD classes from purging
  safelist: [
    'motd-display',
    'motd-content',
    'motd-content .container',
    'motd-content .title',
    'motd-content .title-border',
    'motd-content .title-text',
    'motd-content .title-subtitle',
    'motd-content .yellow-sign',
    'motd-content .welcome-text',
    'motd-content .warning',
    'motd-content .stats',
    'motd-content .footer',
    'motd-actions',
    'continue-button'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        mythos: {
          // Terminal colors for new interface
          terminal: {
            primary: '#00ff00',
            secondary: '#ff9800',
            background: '#0a0a0a',
            surface: '#1a1a1a',
            text: '#00ff00',
            'text-secondary': '#4caf50',
            error: '#f44336',
            warning: '#ff9800',
            success: '#4caf50',
          },
          // MOTD colors (preserved)
          motd: {
            gold: '#d4af37',
            'gold-bright': '#ffd700',
            background: '#0a0a0a',
          }
        }
      },
      fontFamily: {
        'mono': ['Courier New', 'monospace'],
      },
      animation: {
        'shimmer': 'shimmer 3s ease-in-out infinite',
      },
      keyframes: {
        shimmer: {
          '0%': { opacity: '0.3' },
          '50%': { opacity: '0.7' },
          '100%': { opacity: '0.3' },
        }
      }
    }
  }
