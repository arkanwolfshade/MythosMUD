F# Security Sanitization Enhancement Planning

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing MythosMUD's input **sanitization** system with `ftfy` (Unicode normalization) and `strip-ansi` (ANSI code removal) libraries to provide more robust protection against malicious input while maintaining user input freedom.

**Key Principle**: We focus on **sanitization** (cleaning dangerous content) rather than **validation** (rejecting input), allowing users freeform expression while protecting against injection attacks.

## Background

### Current State

- Basic injection pattern detection via regex in `security_validator.py`
- Simple whitespace normalization in `command_validator.py`
- No Unicode normalization or ANSI code handling
- Limited protection against encoding-based attacks
- **Current approach**: Mix of validation (rejection) and sanitization (cleaning)

### Problem Statement

1. **Unicode Issues**: Players may input text with encoding problems (mojibake, combining characters, invisible Unicode)
2. **ANSI Codes**: Terminal clients might send ANSI escape sequences that could hide malicious content
3. **Security Gaps**: Current sanitization doesn't address these attack vectors
4. **Client Compatibility**: Various client types may send differently encoded input
5. **Input Philosophy**: Current system mixes validation (rejection) with sanitization (cleaning), potentially limiting user expression

## Proposed Solution

### Input Philosophy: Sanitization Over Validation

**Core Principle**: Users should have maximum freedom to express themselves in the MUD environment. Our security approach focuses on **sanitizing** potentially dangerous content rather than **validating** and rejecting input.

**Sanitization vs Validation**:

- **Sanitization**: Clean dangerous content while preserving user intent
- **Validation**: Reject input that doesn't meet specific criteria

**Examples**:

- ✅ **Sanitization**: Remove ANSI codes from "Hello \033[31mWorld\033[0m" → "Hello World"
- ❌ **Validation**: Reject "Hello \033[31mWorld\033[0m" entirely
- ✅ **Sanitization**: Fix Unicode "café" (combining characters) → "café" (composed)
- ❌ **Validation**: Reject text with combining characters

### Libraries to Implement

#### 1. ftfy (Fixes Text For You)

- **Purpose**: Fixes common Unicode encoding issues
- **Version**: `>=6.1.3`
- **Key Features**:
  - Mojibake detection and correction
  - Combining character normalization
  - Invisible Unicode character removal
  - Curly quote conversion
  - Line break normalization

#### 2. strip-ansi

- **Purpose**: Removes ANSI escape codes from text
- **Version**: `>=0.1.1`
- **Key Features**:
  - ANSI color code removal
  - Cursor movement code removal
  - Terminal escape sequence cleanup

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dependency Addition

1. **Add dependencies to `pyproject.toml`**

   ```toml
   "ftfy>=6.1.3", # Fixes "bad" Unicode input safely
   "strip-ansi>=0.1.1", # Removes ANSI escape codes
   ```

2. **Update virtual environment**
   - Run `uv sync` to install new dependencies
   - Verify installation with test imports

### Phase 2: Security Validator Enhancement

1. **Enhance `server/validators/security_validator.py`**
   - Add import statements for new libraries
   - Create `sanitize_unicode_input()` function using ftfy
   - Create `strip_ansi_codes()` function using strip-ansi
   - Create `comprehensive_sanitize_input()` function that combines both
   - Add control character removal for additional security
   - **Review existing validation patterns**: Ensure they focus on sanitization rather than rejection

2. **Function Specifications**

   ```python
   def sanitize_unicode_input(text: str) -> str:
       """Fix Unicode encoding issues using ftfy."""

   def strip_ansi_codes(text: str) -> str:
       """Remove ANSI escape codes from text."""

   def comprehensive_sanitize_input(text: str) -> str:
       """Apply all sanitization layers to input."""
   ```

### Phase 3: Command Validator Integration

1. **Update `server/validators/command_validator.py`**
   - Import new sanitization functions
   - Modify `clean_command_input()` to use comprehensive sanitization
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing function signatures
   - Add logging for sanitization operations
   - **Review validation logic**: Ensure `is_suspicious_input()` focuses on true injection attempts, not legitimate user expression

2. **Integration Points**
   - Apply sanitization before command normalization
   - Log sanitization changes for debugging
   - Preserve original input for comparison

### Phase 4: Package Export Updates

1. **Update `server/validators/__init__.py`**
   - Export new sanitization functions
   - Update `__all__` list
   - Maintain existing API compatibility

### Phase 5: Testing Implementation

1. **Create comprehensive test suite**
   - Test Unicode normalization scenarios
   - Test ANSI code removal scenarios
   - Test combined sanitization
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Test performance impact
   - **Test user expression freedom**: Ensure legitimate user input isn't rejected
   - **Test sanitization vs validation**: Verify we're cleaning, not rejecting

2. **Test Scenarios**
   - Mojibake text (double-encoded Unicode)
   - Combining characters (e.g., e + combining acute accent)
   - Invisible Unicode characters (zero-width spaces)
   - ANSI color codes and cursor movement
   - Mixed malicious input
   - Empty and null inputs
   - **Legitimate user expression**: Creative text, roleplay content, non-English text
   - **Edge cases**: Unusual but harmless Unicode sequences
   - **False positive prevention**: Ensure normal user input isn't flagged as suspicious

### Phase 6: Documentation and Validation

1. **Update documentation**
   - Add security enhancement notes to relevant docs
   - Document new function APIs
   - Update security guidelines

2. **Performance validation**
   - Measure sanitization overhead
   - Test with various input sizes
   - Ensure acceptable performance for real-time use

## Technical Details

### ftfy Configuration

```python
# Recommended ftfy settings for MUD environment
ftfy.fix_text(
    text,
    normalization='NFC',  # Normalize to composed form
    remove_terminal_escapes=True,  # Remove terminal codes
    fix_encoding=True,  # Fix encoding issues
    remove_control_chars=True,  # Remove control characters
)
```

### strip-ansi Usage

```python
# Simple ANSI removal
import strip_ansi
cleaned_text = strip_ansi.strip_ansi(input_text)
```

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **Graceful degradation**: If sanitization fails, fall back to basic cleaning
2. **Logging**: Record sanitization operations and failures
3. **Input preservation**: Keep original input for debugging
4. **Performance monitoring**: Track sanitization time impact

## Security Considerations

### Attack Vectors Addressed

1. **Unicode-based injection**: Fixed by ftfy normalization
2. **ANSI code hiding**: Prevented by strip-ansi
3. **Control character injection**: Removed by additional regex
4. **Encoding confusion attacks**: Resolved by proper Unicode handling

### Potential Risks

1. **Performance impact**: Sanitization adds processing overhead
2. **False positives**: Over-sanitization might affect legitimate input
3. **Library vulnerabilities**: Dependencies must be kept updated
4. **Backward compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality isn't broken
5. **Over-validation**: Accidentally rejecting legitimate user expression
6. **User experience impact**: Sanitization that changes user intent
