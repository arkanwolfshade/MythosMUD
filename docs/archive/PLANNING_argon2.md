MEMORY_COST = 65536  # Memory usage in KiB (64MB)
PARALLELISM = 1      # Number of parallel threads
HASH_LENGTH = 32     # Length of the hash in bytes
```

### ✅ Hash Format - IMPLEMENTED

- Argon2 hashes are self-contained (include salt and parameters)
- Format: `$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=1$...`
