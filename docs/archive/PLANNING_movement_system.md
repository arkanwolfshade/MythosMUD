## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a dynamic room tracking system that enables multiplayer awareness and real-time room state management. The system will transform static room representations into living entities that track players, objects, and NPCs.

## Design Decisions

### Core Architecture

**✅ Real-time tracking only**: Players disappear from rooms when they log out

**✅ Simple ID-based tracking**: Objects and NPCs tracked by IDs only (stubs for future implementation)

**✅ Complete replacement**: Room objects replace dictionary-based room cache

- **✅ Event-driven API**: Room methods trigger events for state changes
- **✅ MovementService**: Centralized service for atomic movement operations
- **✅ In-memory event bus**: Simple pub/sub system (Redis-ready for future)
- **✅ Stateless Room objects**: Recreated from JSON data, no persistent state
- **✅ Server-lifetime cache**: All rooms loaded at startup, no cleanup
- **✅ Fail-fast error handling**: Exceptions for invalid states during development
- **✅ Test-driven development**: Comprehensive testing at each phase

### ✅ Room Object Design - IMPLEMENTED

**✅ Location**: `server/models/room.py`

**✅ Event methods**: `player_entered()`, `player_left()`, `object_added()`, `object_removed()`, `npc_entered()`, `npc_left()`

**✅ Tracking**: Player IDs, object IDs, and NPC IDs only

- **✅ Integration**: EventBus for notifications

### ✅ Movement Service Design - IMPLEMENTED

**✅ Location**: `server/game/movement_service.py`

**✅ Atomic operations**: ACID properties for player movement

**✅ Validation**: Movement rules and room existence checks

- **✅ Coordination**: Between Room objects and PersistenceLayer

### ✅ Event System Design - IMPLEMENTED

**✅ Location**: `server/events/`

**✅ Event types**: `PlayerEnteredRoom`, `PlayerLeftRoom`, `ObjectAddedToRoom`, `ObjectRemovedFromRoom`, `NPCEnteredRoom`, `NPCLeftRoom`

**✅ Processing**: Asynchronous, non-blocking

- **✅ Architecture**: In-memory pub/sub (migratable to Redis)

    def player_entered(self, player_id: str) -> None:
        # Add player to room, trigger event

        pass

    def player_left(self, player_id: str) -> None:
        # Remove player from room, trigger event

        pass
```

class MovementService:
    def move_player(self, player_id: str, from_room_id: str, to_room_id: str) -> bool:
        # Atomic movement operation

        pass

        # Validate movement rules

        pass

class EventBus:
    def publish(self, event: BaseEvent) -> None:
