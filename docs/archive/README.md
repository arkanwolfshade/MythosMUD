*"The past is never dead. It's not even past."* - William Faulkner

## Overview

This directory contains planning and technical documentation that has been consolidated into the main `PLANNING.md` document. These documents are preserved for historical reference and detailed technical specifications, but the current planning status and priorities are now maintained in the single source of truth: `PLANNING.md`.

## Why These Documents Were Archived

### Consolidation Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All planning information is now in `PLANNING.md`
2. **Reduced Maintenance**: No more scattered planning documents to keep in sync
3. **Clear Status Tracking**: Easy to see what's completed vs. pending
4. **Priority Organization**: Critical items clearly identified
5. **Historical Preservation**: Technical details preserved for reference

### Current Planning Status

**Main Planning Document**: `PLANNING.md` (root directory)

**Task Tracking**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/arkanwolfshade/MythosMUD/issues)

**Current Priorities**: Phase 1 Critical Fixes (Rate Limiting, Error Handling, API Consistency, Performance)
