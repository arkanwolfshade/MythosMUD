# Security Fixes and Improvements

This document tracks security vulnerabilities that have been identified and fixed in the MythosMUD project.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Stack Trace Exposure (CWE-209) - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: CodeQL alert #43 - Stack trace information could be exposed to external users
**Location**: `server/error_handlers.py` line 71
**Severity**: Medium
**CWE**: CWE-209 - Information Exposure Through an Exception

**Root Cause**: The `create_error_response` function was exposing sensitive information including stack traces, file paths, and internal details when `include_details=True`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented comprehensive sanitization in `_sanitize_detail_value()` function
- Added `_is_safe_detail_key()` to filter out sensitive detail keys
- Added `_sanitize_context()` to clean error context information
- Integrated **Bleach library** for HTML sanitization to prevent XSS
- Added utility functions `sanitize_html_content()` and `sanitize_text_content()`

**Files Modified**:
- `server/error_handlers.py` - Enhanced sanitization logic
- `server/tests/test_error_handlers.py` - Added comprehensive tests
- `pyproject.toml` - Added bleach dependency

**Security Improvements**:
- Prevents exposure of stack traces, file paths, and internal system information
- Blocks sensitive keys like "password", "secret", "file_path", "sql_query", etc.
- Sanitizes HTML content to prevent XSS attacks
- Limits output length to prevent information disclosure
- Maintains safe, user-friendly error messages

**Testing**: 20 comprehensive tests added to verify sanitization works correctly

### 2. GitHub Actions Token Permissions - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: Scorecard alert #46 - Token permissions not properly restricted
**Location**: `.github/workflows/scorecards.yml`
**Severity**: Medium

**Root Cause**: The `scorecards.yml` workflow was using `permissions: read-all` instead of the more restrictive `permissions: contents: read`.

**Fix Applied**: Updated all workflows to use `permissions: contents: read` where appropriate.

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/scorecards.yml` - Changed from `read-all` to `contents: read`

**Verification**: All workflows now have proper permission restrictions:
- ✅ `ci.yml` - `permissions: contents: read`
- ✅ `codeql.yml` - `permissions: contents: read`
- ✅ `dependency-review.yml` - `permissions: contents: read`
- ✅ `semgrep.yml` - `permissions: contents: read`
- ✅ `scorecards.yml` - `permissions: contents: read` (updated)

### 3. NPM Command Pinning - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: Pinned-Dependencies alert #15 - npm command not pinned by hash
**Location**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` line 106
**Severity**: Low

**Root Cause**: The `npm install` command was not pinned to a specific version.

**Fix Applied**: Updated Node.js setup to include specific npm version.

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added npm version specification

## Security Libraries Added

### Bleach (HTML Sanitization)
- **Version**: 6.2.0+
- **Purpose**: HTML content sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- **Usage**: Integrated into error handling and general content sanitization
- **Features**:
  - Removes dangerous HTML tags and attributes
  - Whitelist-based sanitization
  - Link sanitization
  - Text escaping

## Best Practices Implemented

### Error Handling Security
1. **Information Exposure Prevention**: All error details are sanitized before user exposure
2. **Pattern-Based Filtering**: Sensitive patterns are automatically redacted
3. **Length Limiting**: Output is truncated to prevent information disclosure
4. **HTML Sanitization**: All content is sanitized to prevent XSS

### Workflow Security
1. **Minimal Permissions**: All workflows use the least privileged permissions necessary
2. **Dependency Pinning**: All external dependencies are pinned to specific versions
3. **Security Scanning**: Multiple security tools integrated (CodeQL, Semgrep, Scorecards)

## Ongoing Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Semgrep**: Pattern-based security scanning
- **Scorecards**: Security best practices assessment
- **Dependency Review**: Vulnerability scanning for dependencies

### Manual Security Reviews
- Regular code reviews focusing on security
- Input validation testing
- Error handling verification
- Permission model validation
