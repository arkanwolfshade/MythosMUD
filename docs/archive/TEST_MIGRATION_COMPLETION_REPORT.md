**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** Further 15-file reduction

Files marked with `*_legacy.py` suffix need to be:
1. Reviewed for unique test cases
2. Merged into primary test file
3. Duplicates removed
4. Tests validated

### 2. Test Validation

**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Impact:** Confirm migration success

Actions:
1. Run full test suite: `make test-all`
2. Verify coverage: `make coverage`
3. Check for import errors
4. Validate all tests pass

### 3. Documentation Finalization

**After:**
- Consistent naming conventions
- Duplicates identified (legacy files)
- Clear test type separation
- Hierarchical organization

### Maintainability

**Before:**
- 204 files in single directory
- No clear patterns
- Difficult to review
- Onboarding challenging

- ✅ Easy test discovery and navigation
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Automated tooling for maintenance

**Status: MIGRATION COMPLETE** 🎉

**Remaining Work:**
