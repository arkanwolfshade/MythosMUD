## 📊 Key Metrics

### Current State

- **Files:** 204 test files
- **Tests:** 519+ test functions/classes
- **Structure:** Flat with minimal organization
- **Issues:** Difficult to navigate, inconsistent naming

### Target State

- **Files:** ~168 test files (18% reduction)
- **Tests:** 519+ (same tests, better organized)
- **Structure:** Hierarchical with 9 categories, 23+ subdirectories
- **Benefits:** Easy navigation, consistent patterns

### Categories Defined

1. **unit/** (15 subdirectories) - Isolated component tests
2. **integration/** (8 subdirectories) - Component interaction tests
3. **e2e/** - End-to-end workflow tests
4. **performance/** - Performance benchmarks
5. **security/** - Security-focused tests
6. **coverage/** - Coverage improvement tests
7. **regression/** - Bug fix regression tests
8. **monitoring/** - Monitoring/observability tests
9. **verification/** - Standards compliance tests

## 🎓 Academic Note

*"The reorganization of our test archives follows the same principles we apply to cataloguing the forbidden tomes in the Miskatonic Library. Each test, like each manuscript, must have its proper place, clearly marked and easily retrievable. Only through such systematic organization can we hope to maintain the integrity of our knowledge and prevent its descent into chaos."*
