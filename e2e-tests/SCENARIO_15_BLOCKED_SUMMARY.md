# Scenario 15 Blocked - Quick Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-29 09:20 PST
**Status:** ‚ùå **BLOCKED - Feature Not Implemented**
**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM-HIGH

---

## What Happened

During Scenario 15 execution, discovered that **per-recipient whisper rate limiting is not implemented**.

## Evidence

**Test:** Sent 4 rapid whispers to Ithaqua within 8 seconds
**Expected:** Message 4 should be blocked with rate limit error
**Actual:** All 4 messages succeeded

## What Exists

- ‚úÖ Global whisper rate limit: 5 messages/min per player
- ‚úÖ Rate limit configuration and tracking working correctly

## What's Missing

- ‚ùå Per-recipient rate limit: 3 whispers/min to same player
- ‚ùå Tracking of whisper counts per individual recipient
- ‚ùå Differentiated error messages for global vs per-recipient limits

## Impact

**Security:**

- Players can send up to 5 whispers to a SINGLE recipient
- Harassment prevention only partially effective

**Testing:**

- Scenario 15 cannot be completed (6/10 test steps blocked)
- Cannot verify per-recipient rate limiting behavior

## Documentation Created

- `SCENARIO_15_RATE_LIMITING_BLOCKED.md` - Full technical details and implementation plan
- Investigation report updated with blocker details
- Remaining work summary updated with scenario status

## Next Steps

**Option 1: Skip and Continue**
Continue with Scenarios 16-18 (not affected by this limitation)

**Option 2: Implement Feature**
Implement per-recipient rate limiting (6-8 hours estimated)

**Option 3: Defer**
Mark as known limitation and return to it later

---

**Recommendation:** Continue with Scenarios 16-18 first, then decide whether to implement per-recipient rate limiting based on priority.
