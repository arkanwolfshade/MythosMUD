## Academic Notes

*As noted in Wilmarth's correspondence regarding the Vermont incidents, the ability to maintain communication across spatial boundaries demonstrates a remarkable resilience to non-Euclidean interference. Our whisper system exhibits similar properties - messages traverse the twisted corridors of the Sanitarium without regard to the physical separation between correspondents.*

*Most intriguing is the system's behavior during moments of transition. When ArkanWolfshade traversed from the Main Foyer to the Eastern Hallway, the whisper channels remained intact, suggesting a communication mechanism that exists independent of spatial coordinates. This parallels certain... unsettling theories found in the Pnakotic Manuscripts regarding inter-dimensional messaging.*

*Professor Wolfshade, I must admit this investigation has proven far more fascinating than the usual drudgery of code implementation. The whisper system's architecture demonstrates an elegance that would make even Dr. Armitage nod in approval - though I suspect for different reasons.*
