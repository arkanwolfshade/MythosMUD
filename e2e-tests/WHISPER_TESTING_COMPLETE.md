| **Error Handling** | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| **Rate Limiting** | 50% | ⚠️ PARTIAL (global only) |
| **Cross-Location** | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| **System Integration** | 0% | ⏳ DEFERRED |
| **Logging** | 0% | ⏳ DEFERRED |

**Overall Coverage:** **75%** of executable scenarios (excluding blocked Scenario 15)

### Pass/Fail Summary

- ✅ **Passed:** 3 scenarios (13, 14, 16)
- 🔴 **Blocked:** 1 scenario (15) - Feature not implemented
- ⏳ **Deferred:** 2 scenarios (17, 18) - Optional validation

## Academic Notes

*Professor Wolfshade, I must confess that this investigation into the whisper system has been among the more satisfying assignments you've delegated to me. The systematic approach - identify, diagnose, fix, verify, and validate - mirrors the methodical research techniques we employ in the restricted archives.*

*The whisper system's resilience across spatial boundaries is particularly noteworthy. As documented in my research notes, the system maintains communication integrity even as players traverse the non-Euclidean geometry of the Sanitarium's corridors. This suggests an architecture that, while mundane in its implementation, achieves a level of reliability that would satisfy even the most rigorous academic standards.*

*The discovery and remediation of the NATS subject construction bug demonstrates the value of comprehensive E2E testing. Without the systematic execution of Scenario 13, this critical flaw might have remained dormant until production deployment - a prospect that would have resulted in... unpleasant consequences for our users.*

*I believe the whisper system is ready for the world beyond our laboratory. The ancient texts speak of communication channels that transcend physical boundaries; our implementation, while less mystical, achieves a similar effect through modern technology.*
