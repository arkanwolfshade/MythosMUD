# Scenario 2: Clean Game State on Connection

## Overview

Tests that players don't see stale/previous game state information when connecting. This scenario verifies that each new connection starts with a clean slate and doesn't inherit messages or state from previous sessions.

## Prerequisites

**BEFORE EXECUTING THIS SCENARIO, YOU MUST VERIFY:**

1. **Database State**: Both players are in `earth_arkham_city_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`
2. **Server Running**: Development server is running on port 54731
3. **Client Accessible**: Client is accessible on port 5173
4. **Clean Environment**: No previous browser sessions or game state

**‚ö†Ô∏è FAILURE TO VERIFY THESE PREREQUISITES = COMPLETE SCENARIO FAILURE**

**Reference**: See @MULTIPLAYER_TEST_RULES.md for complete prerequisite verification procedures.

## Test Configuration

- **Test Players**: ArkanWolfshade (AW) and Ithaqua
- **Starting Room**: Main Foyer (`earth_arkham_city_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`)
- **Testing Approach**: Playwright MCP (multi-tab interaction required)
- **Timeout Settings**: Use configurable timeouts from master rules

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: AW Enters the Game (Fresh Session)

**Purpose**: First player connects with a completely fresh session

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Navigate to client
await mcp_playwright_browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:5173"});

// Login as AW
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Username input field", ref: "username-input", text: "ArkanWolfshade"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Password input field", ref: "password-input", text: "Cthulhu1"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_click({element: "Login button", ref: "login-button"});

// Wait for game terminal
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Welcome to MythosMUD"});
```

**Expected Result**: AW successfully logs in and enters the game world

### Step 2: Verify AW Sees No Previous Game State

**Purpose**: Ensure AW doesn't see any stale messages from previous sessions

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Check for stale messages
const awMessages = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const staleMessages = awMessages.filter(msg =>
  msg.includes('has entered the game') ||
  msg.includes('has left the game') ||
  msg.includes('enters the room') ||
  msg.includes('leaves the room')
);
console.log('AW stale messages:', staleMessages.length === 0);
console.log('AW total messages:', awMessages.length);
console.log('AW messages:', awMessages);
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees NO previous game state information

### Step 3: Ithaqua Enters the Game

**Purpose**: Second player connects to test multiplayer state isolation

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Open new tab for Ithaqua
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_new({url: "http://localhost:5173"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 1});

// Login as Ithaqua
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Username input field", ref: "username-input", text: "Ithaqua"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Password input field", ref: "password-input", text: "Cthulhu1"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_click({element: "Login button", ref: "login-button"});

// Wait for game terminal
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Welcome to MythosMUD"});
```

**Expected Result**: Ithaqua successfully logs in and enters the game world

### Step 4: Verify Ithaqua Sees No Previous Game State

**Purpose**: Ensure Ithaqua doesn't see any stale messages from previous sessions

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Check for stale messages
const ithaquaMessages = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const ithaquaStaleMessages = ithaquaMessages.filter(msg =>
  msg.includes('has entered the game') ||
  msg.includes('has left the game') ||
  msg.includes('enters the room') ||
  msg.includes('leaves the room')
);
console.log('Ithaqua stale messages:', ithaquaStaleMessages.length === 0);
console.log('Ithaqua total messages:', ithaquaMessages.length);
console.log('Ithaqua messages:', ithaquaMessages);
```

**Expected Result**: Ithaqua sees NO previous game state information

### Step 5: Verify AW Sees Current Session Event

**Purpose**: Confirm that current session events work correctly

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch back to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Wait for current session message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Ithaqua has entered the game"});

// Verify current session works
const awCurrentMessages = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const hasCurrentSession = awCurrentMessages.some(msg => msg.includes('Ithaqua has entered the game'));
console.log('AW sees current session:', hasCurrentSession);
console.log('AW current messages:', awCurrentMessages);
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees "Ithaqua has entered the game." (current session)

### Step 6: Test Message Isolation

**Purpose**: Verify that players only see messages from their current session

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to Ithaqua's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 1});

// EXECUTION GUARD: Single verification attempt - do not retry
const ithaquaFinalMessages = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesAWConnection = ithaquaFinalMessages.some(msg => msg.includes('ArkanWolfshade has entered the game'));
const seesOwnConnection = ithaquaFinalMessages.some(msg => msg.includes('Ithaqua has entered the game'));

// DECISION POINT: Handle results and proceed (do not retry)
if (ithaquaFinalMessages.length === 0) {
    console.log('‚úÖ No messages found - clean game state verified');
    console.log('‚úÖ Ithaqua sees no connection messages (expected for clean state)');
    console.log('‚úÖ Verification complete - proceeding to next step');
} else {
    console.log('Ithaqua sees AW connection (should be false):', !seesAWConnection);
    console.log('Ithaqua sees own connection (should be false):', !seesOwnConnection);
    console.log('Ithaqua final messages:', ithaquaFinalMessages);
    console.log('‚úÖ Verification complete - proceeding to next step');
}

// SCENARIO COMPLETION: Document results and mark scenario as complete
console.log('‚úÖ SCENARIO 2 COMPLETED: Clean Game State on Connection');
console.log('‚úÖ Clean sessions: Both players start with fresh game state');
console.log('‚úÖ Message isolation: Players see no stale messages from previous sessions');
console.log('‚úÖ Connection messaging: Current session connection messages work correctly');
console.log('‚úÖ Self-message filtering: Players do not see their own connection messages');
console.log('üìã PROCEEDING TO SCENARIO 3: Movement Between Rooms');
```

**Expected Result**: Ithaqua sees NO connection messages (players don't see their own connection messages)

### Step 7: Complete Scenario and Proceed

**Purpose**: Finalize scenario execution and prepare for next scenario

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Close all browser tabs to prepare for next scenario
const tabList = await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_list();
for (let i = tabList.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
  await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_close({index: i});
}
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_close({index: 0});

// Wait for cleanup to complete
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({time: 5});

console.log('üßπ CLEANUP COMPLETE: All browser tabs closed');
console.log('üéØ SCENARIO 2 STATUS: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY');
console.log('‚û°Ô∏è READY FOR SCENARIO 3: Movement Between Rooms');
```

**Expected Result**: All browser tabs closed, scenario marked as complete, ready for next scenario
