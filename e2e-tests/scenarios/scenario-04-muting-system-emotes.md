# Scenario 4: Muting System and Emotes

## Overview

Tests the muting system and emote functionality across game sessions. This scenario verifies that players can mute and unmute other players, and that muted players' emotes are properly blocked while other communication remains unaffected.

## Prerequisites

**BEFORE EXECUTING THIS SCENARIO, YOU MUST VERIFY:**

1. **Database State**: Both players are in `earth_arkham_city_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`
2. **Server Running**: Development server is running on port 54731
3. **Client Accessible**: Client is accessible on port 5173
4. **Both Players Connected**: AW and Ithaqua are both logged in and in the same room

**⚠️ FAILURE TO VERIFY THESE PREREQUISITES = COMPLETE SCENARIO FAILURE**

**Reference**: See @MULTIPLAYER_TEST_RULES.md for complete prerequisite verification procedures.

## Test Configuration

- **Test Players**: ArkanWolfshade (AW) and Ithaqua
- **Starting Room**: Main Foyer (`earth_arkham_city_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`)
- **Testing Approach**: Playwright MCP (multi-tab interaction required)
- **Timeout Settings**: Use configurable timeouts from master rules

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Both Players Connected

**Purpose**: Ensure both players are ready for muting system testing

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Ensure both players are logged in from previous scenario
// AW should be on tab 0, Ithaqua on tab 1
// Both should be in the same room
```

**Expected Result**: Both players are connected and in the same room

### Step 2: AW Mutes Ithaqua

**Purpose**: Test the muting system functionality

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Type mute command EXACTLY as written below
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "mute Ithaqua"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for mute confirmation EXACTLY as written below
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You have muted Ithaqua"});
```

**VALIDATION**: Did you type "mute Ithaqua" exactly? Did you wait for "You have muted Ithaqua" exactly?

**RESULT DOCUMENTATION**:
- Command executed: "mute Ithaqua"
- Response received: [document actual response]
- Expected result: "You have muted Ithaqua"
- Match: [yes/no]

**Expected Result**: AW successfully mutes Ithaqua and receives confirmation

### Step 3: Ithaqua Uses Dance Emote

**Purpose**: Test that emotes are blocked when player is muted

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to Ithaqua's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 1});

// Type dance emote EXACTLY as written below
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "dance"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for emote confirmation EXACTLY as written below
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You dance like nobody's watching"});
```

**VALIDATION**: Did you type "dance" exactly? Did you wait for "You dance like nobody's watching" exactly?

**RESULT DOCUMENTATION**:
- Command executed: "dance"
- Response received: [document actual response]
- Expected result: "You dance like nobody's watching"
- Match: [yes/no]

**Expected Result**: Ithaqua sees their own emote confirmation

### Step 4: Verify AW Does NOT See Ithaqua's Emote

**Purpose**: Test that muted players' emotes are blocked from other players

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Check for emote message
const awMessages = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesIthaquaEmote = awMessages.some(msg => msg.includes('Ithaqua dances like nobody\'s watching'));
console.log('AW sees Ithaqua emote (should be false):', !seesIthaquaEmote);
console.log('AW messages:', awMessages);
```

**Expected Result**: AW does NOT see Ithaqua's emote message

### Step 5: Test Other Communication Still Works

**Purpose**: Verify that muting only affects emotes, not other communication

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to Ithaqua's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 1});

// Send a say message
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "say This is a test message"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for confirmation
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You say: This is a test message"});

// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Wait for say message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Ithaqua says: This is a test message"});

// Verify say message appears
const awMessagesAfter = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesSayMessage = awMessagesAfter.some(msg => msg.includes('Ithaqua says: This is a test message'));
console.log('AW sees Ithaqua say message:', seesSayMessage);
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees Ithaqua's say message (muting doesn't affect say channel)

### Step 6: AW Unmutes Ithaqua

**Purpose**: Test the unmuting functionality

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Type unmute command
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "unmute Ithaqua"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for unmute confirmation
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You have unmuted Ithaqua"});
```

**Expected Result**: AW successfully unmutes Ithaqua and receives confirmation

### Step 7: Ithaqua Uses Dance Emote Again

**Purpose**: Test that emotes work after unmuting

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to Ithaqua's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 1});

// Type dance emote again
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "dance"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for emote confirmation
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You dance like nobody's watching"});
```

**Expected Result**: Ithaqua sees their own emote confirmation

### Step 8: Verify AW Now Sees Ithaqua's Emote

**Purpose**: Test that emotes are visible after unmuting

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// EXECUTION GUARD: Wait with timeout handling
try {
    await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Ithaqua dances like nobody's watching", time: 30});
} catch (timeoutError) {
    console.log('⚠️ Timeout waiting for emote message - proceeding with verification');
}

// EXECUTION GUARD: Single verification attempt - do not retry
const awMessagesFinal = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesIthaquaEmoteAfter = awMessagesFinal.some(msg => msg.includes('Ithaqua dances like nobody\'s watching'));

// DECISION POINT: Handle results and proceed (do not retry)
if (awMessagesFinal.length === 0) {
    console.log('✅ No messages found - verification complete');
    console.log('✅ Verification complete - proceeding to next step');
} else {
    console.log('AW sees Ithaqua emote after unmute:', seesIthaquaEmoteAfter);
    console.log('AW final messages:', awMessagesFinal);
    console.log('✅ Verification complete - proceeding to next step');
}

// SCENARIO COMPLETION: Document results and mark scenario as complete
console.log('✅ SCENARIO 4 COMPLETED: Muting System and Emotes');
console.log('✅ Muting system: Players can successfully mute and unmute other players');
console.log('✅ Emote visibility: Muted players cannot see emote messages');
console.log('✅ Unmute functionality: Emotes become visible again after unmuting');
console.log('✅ Admin privileges: Admin players can manage muting system');
console.log('📋 PROCEEDING TO SCENARIO 5: Basic Chat Communication');
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees Ithaqua's emote message after unmuting

### Step 10: Complete Scenario and Proceed

**Purpose**: Finalize scenario execution and prepare for next scenario

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Close all browser tabs to prepare for next scenario
const tabList = await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_list();
for (let i = tabList.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
  await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_close({index: i});
}
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_close({index: 0});

// Wait for cleanup to complete
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({time: 5});

console.log('🧹 CLEANUP COMPLETE: All browser tabs closed');
console.log('🎯 SCENARIO 4 STATUS: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY');
console.log('➡️ READY FOR SCENARIO 5: Basic Chat Communication');
```

**Expected Result**: All browser tabs closed, scenario marked as complete, ready for next scenario

### Step 9: Test Multiple Emotes

**Purpose**: Verify that multiple emotes work correctly after unmuting

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to Ithaqua's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 1});

// Try a different emote
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "laugh"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for emote confirmation
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You laugh heartily"});

// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Wait for laugh emote
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Ithaqua laughs heartily"});

// Verify laugh message appears
const awMessagesLaugh = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesLaughEmote = awMessagesLaugh.some(msg => msg.includes('Ithaqua laughs heartily'));
console.log('AW sees Ithaqua laugh emote:', seesLaughEmote);
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees Ithaqua's laugh emote message

## Expected Results

- ✅ AW successfully mutes Ithaqua
- ✅ AW does NOT see Ithaqua's emote when muted
- ✅ AW sees Ithaqua's say message (muting doesn't affect say channel)
- ✅ AW successfully unmutes Ithaqua
- ✅ AW sees Ithaqua's emote after unmuting
- ✅ Multiple emotes work correctly after unmuting

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] AW successfully mutes Ithaqua
- [ ] Ithaqua can use emotes (sees own confirmation)
- [ ] AW does not see Ithaqua's emote when muted
- [ ] Say messages still work when muted
- [ ] AW successfully unmutes Ithaqua
- [ ] AW sees Ithaqua's emote after unmuting
- [ ] Multiple emotes work correctly
