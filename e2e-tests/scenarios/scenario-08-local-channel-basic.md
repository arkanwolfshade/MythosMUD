# Scenario 8: Local Channel Basic

## Overview

Tests basic local channel communication functionality. This scenario verifies that players can send and receive local channel messages, that messages are properly broadcast to players in the same sub-zone, and that the local channel system works correctly for basic multiplayer communication.

## Prerequisites

**BEFORE EXECUTING THIS SCENARIO, YOU MUST VERIFY:**

1. **Database State**: Both players are in `earth_arkham_city_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`
2. **Server Running**: Development server is running on port 54731
3. **Client Accessible**: Client is accessible on port 5173
4. **Both Players Connected**: AW and Ithaqua are both logged in and in the same room

**⚠️ FAILURE TO VERIFY THESE PREREQUISITES = COMPLETE SCENARIO FAILURE**

**Reference**: See @MULTIPLAYER_TEST_RULES.md for complete prerequisite verification procedures.

## Test Configuration

- **Test Players**: ArkanWolfshade (AW) and Ithaqua
- **Starting Room**: Main Foyer (`earth_arkham_city_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`)
- **Testing Approach**: Playwright MCP (multi-tab interaction required)
- **Timeout Settings**: Use configurable timeouts from master rules

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Both Players in Same Sub-Zone

**Purpose**: Ensure both players are ready for local channel testing

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Ensure both players are logged in from previous scenario
// AW should be on tab 0, Ithaqua on tab 1
// Both should be in the same room (same sub-zone)
```

**Expected Result**: Both players are connected and in the same sub-zone

### Step 2: AW Sends Local Channel Message

**Purpose**: Test basic local channel message sending

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Type local channel message
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "local Hello everyone in the sanitarium"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for confirmation message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You say locally: Hello everyone in the sanitarium"});
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees confirmation of their own local message

### Step 3: Verify Ithaqua Sees AW's Local Message

**Purpose**: Test that local channel messages are properly broadcast to other players

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to Ithaqua's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 1});

// Wait for local message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "ArkanWolfshade says locally: Hello everyone in the sanitarium"});

// Verify message appears
const ithaquaMessages = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesAWLocalMessage = ithaquaMessages.some(msg => msg.includes('ArkanWolfshade says locally: Hello everyone in the sanitarium'));
console.log('Ithaqua sees AW local message:', seesAWLocalMessage);
console.log('Ithaqua messages:', ithaquaMessages);
```

**Expected Result**: Ithaqua sees AW's local channel message

### Step 4: Ithaqua Replies on Local Channel

**Purpose**: Test bidirectional local channel communication

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Type local reply
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "local Greetings ArkanWolfshade"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for confirmation message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You say locally: Greetings ArkanWolfshade"});
```

**Expected Result**: Ithaqua sees confirmation of their own local reply

### Step 5: Verify AW Sees Ithaqua's Local Reply

**Purpose**: Test that replies are properly received on local channel

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Wait for local message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Ithaqua says locally: Greetings ArkanWolfshade"});

// Verify message appears
const awMessages = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesIthaquaLocalMessage = awMessages.some(msg => msg.includes('Ithaqua says locally: Greetings ArkanWolfshade'));
console.log('AW sees Ithaqua local message:', seesIthaquaLocalMessage);
console.log('AW messages:', awMessages);
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees Ithaqua's local channel reply

### Step 6: Test Multiple Local Messages

**Purpose**: Test that multiple local messages work correctly

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Send another local message
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "local How is everyone doing today?"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for confirmation
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You say locally: How is everyone doing today?"});

// Switch to Ithaqua's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 1});

// Wait for second local message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "ArkanWolfshade says locally: How is everyone doing today?"});

// Send reply
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "local I'm doing well, thank you!"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for confirmation
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You say locally: I'm doing well, thank you!"});
```

**Expected Result**: Multiple local messages are sent and received correctly

### Step 7: Test Local Message Formatting

**Purpose**: Verify that local messages are properly formatted

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Wait for Ithaqua's second local message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Ithaqua says locally: I'm doing well, thank you!"});

// Check local message formatting
const awMessagesFinal = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const allLocalMessages = awMessagesFinal.filter(msg => msg.includes('says locally:'));
console.log('All local messages:', allLocalMessages);

// Verify proper formatting
const properLocalFormatting = allLocalMessages.every(msg =>
  msg.includes('says locally:') &&
  (msg.startsWith('ArkanWolfshade says locally:') || msg.startsWith('Ithaqua says locally:'))
);
console.log('Proper local message formatting:', properLocalFormatting);
```

**Expected Result**: All local messages are properly formatted with "PlayerName says locally: message"

### Step 8: Test Local Message History

**Purpose**: Verify that local message history is maintained

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Check total local message count
const totalLocalMessages = awMessagesFinal.filter(msg => msg.includes('says locally:')).length;
console.log('Total local messages in chat:', totalLocalMessages);

// Verify we have the expected local messages
const expectedLocalMessages = [
  'ArkanWolfshade says locally: Hello everyone in the sanitarium',
  'Ithaqua says locally: Greetings ArkanWolfshade',
  'ArkanWolfshade says locally: How is everyone doing today?',
  'Ithaqua says locally: I\'m doing well, thank you!'
];

const hasAllLocalMessages = expectedLocalMessages.every(expectedMsg =>
  awMessagesFinal.some(msg => msg.includes(expectedMsg))
);
console.log('Has all expected local messages:', hasAllLocalMessages);
```

**Expected Result**: All expected local messages are present in the chat history

### Step 9: Test Local Channel vs Say Channel

**Purpose**: Verify that local channel and say channel are distinct

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Send a say message
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "say This is a say message"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// EXECUTION GUARD: Wait with timeout handling
try {
    await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You say: This is a say message", time: 30});
} catch (timeoutError) {
    console.log('⚠️ Timeout waiting for say confirmation - proceeding with verification');
}

// Switch to Ithaqua's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 1});

// Wait for say message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "ArkanWolfshade says: This is a say message"});

// Verify both message types are present
const ithaquaMessagesFinal = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const hasLocalMessages = ithaquaMessagesFinal.some(msg => msg.includes('says locally:'));
const hasSayMessages = ithaquaMessagesFinal.some(msg => msg.includes('says:') && !msg.includes('says locally:'));
console.log('Has local messages:', hasLocalMessages);
console.log('Has say messages:', hasSayMessages);
console.log('Both message types present:', hasLocalMessages && hasSayMessages);
```

**Expected Result**: Both local and say messages are present and distinct

// SCENARIO COMPLETION: Document results and mark scenario as complete
console.log('✅ SCENARIO 8 COMPLETED: Local Channel Basic');
console.log('✅ All verification steps completed successfully');
console.log('✅ System functionality verified as working correctly');
console.log('✅ Test results documented and validated');
console.log('📋 PROCEEDING TO SCENARIO 9: Local Message Isolation');
```

**Expected Result**:  All expected local messages are present in the chat history

### Step 18: Complete Scenario and Proceed

**Purpose**: Finalize scenario execution and prepare for next scenario

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Close all browser tabs to prepare for next scenario
const tabList = await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_list();
for (let i = tabList.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
  await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_close({index: i});
}
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_close({index: 0});

// Wait for cleanup to complete
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({time: 5});

console.log('🧹 CLEANUP COMPLETE: All browser tabs closed');
console.log('🎯 SCENARIO 8 STATUS: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY');
console.log('➡️ READY FOR SCENARIO 9: Local Message Isolation');
```

**Expected Result**: All browser tabs closed, scenario marked as complete, ready for next scenario
