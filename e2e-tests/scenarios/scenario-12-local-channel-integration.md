# Scenario 12: Local Channel Integration **[REQUIRES MULTI-PLAYER]**

## Overview

Tests local channel message broadcasting and real-time delivery to multiple players in the same sub-zone. This scenario verifies that local messages are properly broadcast to all players in the same sub-zone in real-time.

**⚠️ AUTOMATED TESTS AVAILABLE**: Local channel integration points are tested in automated Playwright CLI tests. See `client/tests/e2e/runtime/integration/local-channel-integration.spec.ts` for:
- Player management integration
- Location tracking integration
- Error handling integration
- Logging integration
- Performance testing

This MCP scenario focuses ONLY on message broadcasting verification that requires real-time multi-player coordination.

## Prerequisites

**BEFORE EXECUTING THIS SCENARIO, YOU MUST VERIFY:**

1. **Database State**: Both players are in `earth_arkhamcity_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`
2. **Server Running**: Development server is running on port 54731
3. **Client Accessible**: Client is accessible on port 5173
4. **Both Players Connected**: AW and Ithaqua are both logged in and in the same room

**⚠️ FAILURE TO VERIFY THESE PREREQUISITES = COMPLETE SCENARIO FAILURE**

**Reference**: See @MULTIPLAYER_TEST_RULES.md for complete prerequisite verification procedures.

## Test Configuration

- **Test Players**: ArkanWolfshade (AW) and Ithaqua
- **Starting Room**: Main Foyer (`earth_arkhamcity_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`)
- **Testing Approach**: Playwright MCP (multi-tab interaction required)
- **Timeout Settings**: Use configurable timeouts from master rules

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Both Players in Same Sub-Zone

**Purpose**: Ensure both players are ready for integration testing

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Ensure both players are logged in from previous scenario
// AW should be on tab 0, Ithaqua on tab 1
// Both should be in the same room (same sub-zone)
```

**Expected Result**: Both players are connected and in the same sub-zone

### Step 2: Test Local Channel with Player Management Integration

**Purpose**: Test local channel integration with player management system

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Send local message to test player management integration
await mcp_playwright_browser_type({element: "Command input field", ref: "command-input", text: "local Testing player management integration"});
await mcp_playwright_browser_press_key({key: "Enter"});

// Wait for confirmation
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You say locally: Testing player management integration"});

// Verify message appears
const awMessages = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesPlayerMgmtMessage = awMessages.some(msg => msg.includes('You say locally: Testing player management integration'));
console.log('AW sees player management message:', seesPlayerMgmtMessage);
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees confirmation of local message

### Step 3: Test Local Channel with Location Tracking Integration

**Purpose**: Test local channel integration with location tracking system
