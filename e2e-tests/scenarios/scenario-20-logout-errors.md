# Scenario 20: Logout Errors

## Overview

Tests logout button error handling and fallback mechanisms. This scenario verifies that the logout system properly handles various error conditions, that fallback mechanisms work correctly, that error messages are clear and informative, and that the system remains stable during error conditions.

## Prerequisites

**BEFORE EXECUTING THIS SCENARIO, YOU MUST VERIFY:**

1. **Database State**: Both players are in `earth_arkhamcity_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`
2. **Server Running**: Development server is running on port 54731
3. **Client Accessible**: Client is accessible on port 5173
4. **Both Players Connected**: AW and Ithaqua are both logged in and in the same room

**⚠️ FAILURE TO VERIFY THESE PREREQUISITES = COMPLETE SCENARIO FAILURE**

**Reference**: See @MULTIPLAYER_TEST_RULES.md for complete prerequisite verification procedures.

## Test Configuration

- **Test Players**: ArkanWolfshade (AW) and Ithaqua
- **Starting Room**: Main Foyer (`earth_arkhamcity_sanitarium_room_foyer_001`)
- **Testing Approach**: Playwright MCP (multi-tab interaction required)
- **Timeout Settings**: Use configurable timeouts from master rules

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Both Players Connected

**Purpose**: Ensure both players are ready for logout error testing

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Ensure both players are logged in from previous scenario
// AW should be on tab 0, Ithaqua on tab 1
// Both should be in the same room
```

**Expected Result**: Both players are connected and in the same room

### Step 2: Test Logout Button Error Handling

**Purpose**: Test that logout button handles errors gracefully

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to AW's tab
await mcp_playwright_browser_tab_select({index: 0});

// Check logout button state
const logoutButton = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => document.querySelector('button[data-testid=\"logout-button\"]') || document.querySelector('.logout-button') || document.querySelector('button:contains(\"Logout\")')"});
console.log('Logout button found:', logoutButton !== null);

// Test logout button click
await mcp_playwright_browser_click({element: "Logout button", ref: "logout-button"});

// Wait for logout response
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You have been logged out"});

// Verify logout message appears
const awMessages = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesLogoutMessage = awMessages.some(msg => msg.includes('You have been logged out'));
console.log('AW sees logout message:', seesLogoutMessage);
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees logout confirmation message

### Step 3: Test Logout Error During Network Issues

**Purpose**: Test logout error handling during network issues

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Simulate network issues by disconnecting
await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => { window.navigator.onLine = false; window.dispatchEvent(new Event('offline')); }"});

// Try to logout during network issues
await mcp_playwright_browser_click({element: "Logout button", ref: "logout-button"});

// Wait for error message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Network error: Unable to logout"});

// Verify error message appears
const awMessagesNetwork = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesNetworkError = awMessagesNetwork.some(msg => msg.includes('Network error: Unable to logout'));
console.log('AW sees network error:', seesNetworkError);
```

**Expected Result**: AW receives network error message

### Step 4: Test Logout Error Recovery

**Purpose**: Test that logout system recovers from errors

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Restore network connection
await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => { window.navigator.onLine = true; window.dispatchEvent(new Event('online')); }"});

// Try to logout again after network recovery
await mcp_playwright_browser_click({element: "Logout button", ref: "logout-button"});

// Wait for logout success
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You have been logged out"});

// Verify logout message appears
const awMessagesRecovery = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesLogoutRecovery = awMessagesRecovery.some(msg => msg.includes('You have been logged out'));
console.log('AW sees logout recovery:', seesLogoutRecovery);
```

**Expected Result**: AW sees logout confirmation after error recovery

### Step 5: Test Logout Error During Server Issues

**Purpose**: Test logout error handling during server issues

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Switch to Ithaqua's tab

// Try to logout during server issues
await mcp_playwright_browser_click({element: "Logout button", ref: "logout-button"});

// Wait for error message
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "Server error: Unable to logout"});

// Verify error message appears
const ithaquaMessagesServer = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesServerError = ithaquaMessagesServer.some(msg => msg.includes('Server error: Unable to logout'));
console.log('Ithaqua sees server error:', seesServerError);
```

**Expected Result**: Ithaqua receives server error message

### Step 6: Test Logout Error Fallback

**Purpose**: Test that logout system has proper fallback mechanisms

**Commands**:
```javascript
// Restore fetch function
await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => { window.fetch = originalFetch; }"});

// Try to logout again after server recovery
await mcp_playwright_browser_click({element: "Logout button", ref: "logout-button"});

// Wait for logout success
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You have been logged out"});

// Verify logout message appears
const ithaquaMessagesFallback = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});

// Try to logout again after session recovery
await mcp_playwright_browser_click({element: "Logout button", ref: "logout-button"});

// EXECUTION GUARD: Wait with timeout handling
try {
    await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({text: "You have been logged out", time: 30});
} catch (timeoutError) {
    console.log('⚠️ Timeout waiting for logout confirmation - proceeding with verification');
}

// EXECUTION GUARD: Single verification attempt - do not retry
const awMessagesSessionRecovery = await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({function: "() => Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.message')).map(el => el.textContent.trim())"});
const seesLogoutSessionRecovery = awMessagesSessionRecovery.some(msg => msg.includes('You have been logged out'));
