.SYNOPSIS
    Clean Log Files for MythosMUD

.DESCRIPTION
    This script removes all *.log files from the logs directory and its subdirectories.
    As noted in the restricted archives of Miskatonic University, maintaining clean
    log files is essential for preventing the corruption of temporal signatures
    and ensuring proper system operation.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Show what would be deleted without actually deleting files

.PARAMETER Confirm
    Skip confirmation prompt and delete files immediately

.EXAMPLE
    .\clean_logs.ps1
    Shows what files would be deleted and asks for confirmation

.EXAMPLE
    .\clean_logs.ps1 -DryRun
    Shows what files would be deleted without making changes

.EXAMPLE
    .\clean_logs.ps1 -Confirm
    Deletes all log files without asking for confirmation
