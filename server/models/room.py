"""
Room model for MythosMUD.

This module provides the Room class that represents a room in the game world.
Rooms track their current occupants (players, objects, NPCs) and provide
event-driven methods for state changes.

As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, proper room awareness is essential
for maintaining the integrity of our eldritch architecture and ensuring
that dimensional shifts are properly tracked.

    This class provides a stateless design where room data is loaded from
