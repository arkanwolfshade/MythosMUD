"""
NPC subsystem for MythosMUD.

This package provides the NPC (Non-Player Character) subsystem including
threading, message queues, behaviors, and integration with the main game systems.

As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, proper management of non-human entities
is essential for maintaining the delicate balance between order and chaos
in our eldritch digital realm.
