"""
NPC Communication Integration for MythosMUD.

This module provides integration between NPCs and the existing chat/whisper
systems, allowing NPCs to participate in conversations, respond to messages,
and interact with players through the game's communication channels.

As documented in the Cultes des Goules, proper communication integration is
essential for maintaining the illusion of sentient entities within our
eldritch digital realm.
