"""
NPC Event Subscription and Reaction System.

This module provides a system for NPCs to subscribe to game events and
react to them automatically based on their behavior configuration.

As documented in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the ability of entities to
perceive and respond to dimensional disturbances is crucial for maintaining
the delicate balance of our reality.
