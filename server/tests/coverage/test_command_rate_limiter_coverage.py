Tests for command rate limiter to improve coverage.

This module provides targeted tests for command_rate_limiter.py
to cover the uncovered utility and statistics functions.

As documented in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, proper rate limiting
is essential for preventing eldritch denial-of-service attacks.
