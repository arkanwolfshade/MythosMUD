Integration tests that would have caught the bugs we encountered during debugging.

These tests simulate the actual scenarios that revealed bugs:
1. "twibble" emote not working
2. Players seeing their own movement messages
3. Chat buffer persistence
4. Event storm from multiple EventBus instances
5. Connection timeout issues
