"""
Tests for room synchronization improvements.

This module tests the enhanced room synchronization system including
event processing order, state validation, and room data freshness validation.

As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, proper synchronization of our
dimensional coordinates is essential for maintaining the integrity
of our eldritch architecture.
