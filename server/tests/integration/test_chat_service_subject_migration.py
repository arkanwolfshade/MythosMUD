"""
Integration tests for ChatService NATSSubjectManager migration.

This module tests the integration between ChatService and NATSSubjectManager,
ensuring that chat messages use standardized subject patterns instead of
ad-hoc subject construction.

AI: These tests verify the migration from manual subject construction to
AI: centralized pattern management in ChatService.
