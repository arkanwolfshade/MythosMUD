"""
Tests for dual connection system functionality.

This module tests the dual connection system that allows players to have
both WebSocket and SSE connections simultaneously, enabling seamless
switching between different client interfaces.

As noted in the restricted archives, these tests ensure the stability
of our forbidden knowledge transmission protocols across multiple
connection types.
