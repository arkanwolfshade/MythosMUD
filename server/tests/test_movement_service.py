Tests for the MovementService.

This module tests the MovementService class to ensure proper functionality
of atomic movement operations and ACID properties for player movement
between rooms.

As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, proper testing of movement systems
is essential for maintaining the integrity of our eldritch architecture.
