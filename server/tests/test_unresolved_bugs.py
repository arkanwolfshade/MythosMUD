Tests for unresolved bugs and edge cases that need further investigation.

These tests focus on:
1. The persistent issue where players still see their own entry/exit messages
2. Chat buffer persistence across client reconnections
3. Event ordering and timing issues
4. WebSocket message delivery reliability
5. UUID serialization edge cases
