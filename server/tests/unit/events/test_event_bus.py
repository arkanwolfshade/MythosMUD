"""
Tests for the EventBus system.

This module tests the EventBus class and event types to ensure proper
functionality of the pub/sub system for room state changes and player
movements.

As noted in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, proper testing of dimensional
event systems is essential for maintaining the integrity of our eldritch
architecture.

Updated to use pure asyncio patterns as per the architectural transformation
documented in the asyncio remediation tasks. The EventBus now operates
within async event loops, requiring proper async test coordination.
