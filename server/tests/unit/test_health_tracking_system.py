Test health tracking system with real-time updates and persistence.

This module tests the new health tracking features:
- Real-time health tracking and display
- In-memory NPC health tracking (resets on combat end)
- Persistent player health tracking (saved to database)
- On-demand health status checking commands
- Integration with combat system
